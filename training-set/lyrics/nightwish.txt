They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited till the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
You stand accused of robbery
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him deer
But yet he dare not say
Just where he had been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He'd spent his final night of freedom

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms again he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms again she'll be

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
As sure as the river reach the sea
Back in his arms is where she'll be

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in her arms is where he'll be

Over the hills
Over the hills and far away

A snowy owl above the haunted
Waters poet of ancient gods
Cries to tell the neverending story
Prophecy of becoming floods

An aura of mystery surrounds her
The lady in brightest white
Soon the incarnate shall be born
The Creater of the night

Deep dark is his Majesty's kingdom
A portent of tomorrow's world
There shall the liquid give Him power
The red-eyed unborn lord

Fatal embrace of the bloodred waters
The cradle of infinite gloom
The spell to master this Earth
Carven on an infant's tomb

'I will die for the love of the mermaid
Her seduction, beauty and scorn
Welcome to the end of your life
- Hail the Oceanborn!'

'Disgraced is my virginity
Death has woven my wedding dress
Oh, Great Blue, breathe the morning dew
For you are the cradle for the image of god'

'Brave now, long rest is sweet
With me here in the deep

'I Prayed for pleasure, wished for love
Prayed for your...'

'Never pray for me!'

'Who the hell are you for me
But a mortal dream to see'

'This apathetic life must drown
Forever just for me'

'Leave me be
Leave me be
Leave me be'

'From cradle to coffin
Shall my wickedness be your passion

We shall come to set the dolphins free
We shall wash the darkened bloodred sea
Our songs will echo over the mountains and seas
The eternity will begin once again in peace

We used to swim the same moonlight waters
Oceans away from the wakeful day

- My fall will be for you -
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I`ll bleed forever

Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
Brings me to thee
Into the blue memory

- My fall will be for you -
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I will bleed forever

Into the blue memory

A siren from the deep came to me
Sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be

The Child will be born again
That siren carried him to me
First of them true loves
Singing on the shoulders of an angel
Without care for love n` loss

Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me

Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman`s noose

Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day
I keep on watching us sleep

Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast

Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I`ll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love

- My fall will be for you -
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I`ll bleed forever 
We used to swim the same moonlight waters
Oceans away from the wakeful day

- My fall will be for you -
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I`ll bleed forever

Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
Brings me to thee
Into the blue memory

Wish upon a star
Take a step enter the land
Walk through the air
Take my hand
Wishmaster's will -
Join him the quest for dream
A make-believe
Is all we ever need

Wish upon a star
No matter who you are
The second star to the right
Harbinger's gate
Beyond the boundaries
Blossom ballet
In the great wide somewhere

Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
The master of the tale-like lore
The way to kingdom I adore
Where the warrior's heart is pure
Where the stories will come true

A cub of the king betrayed by usurper
A girl in the rain swearing to her father's name
Belle the last sight for the dying gruesome
The beauties sleeping awaiting
Deep in a dream
For true love's first kiss

Bald Mountain Night
Devilheart endures but light
A mad aerial dance
Chernabog's succubi

Black Cauldron born
Gurgi's heart forlorn
Pig-keeper or hero
On a quest of augury

Maleficent's fury
The spindle so luring
Dragon fight, dying night
Dooming might

Apprentice of Yen Sid
Conducting the galaxy
Dreamer on mountaintop
Spellbound masquerade

The Sailor an idol for the six-year-old in me
The Phoenix of White Agony Creek
Enchantress, A mermaid in a tale as old as time
A Dragonslayer, The Awakener

Wish upon a star...
Born from silence, silence full of it
A perfect concert my best friend
So much to live for, so much to die for
If only my heart had a home

Sing what you can't say
Forget what you can't play
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes
Walk within my poetry, this dying music
- My loveletter to nobody

Never sigh for better world
It's already composed, played and told
Every thought the music I write
Everything a wish for the night

Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin
Died for the beauty the one in the garden
Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom
Failed in becoming a god

Never sigh...

'If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry the one without tears
For I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality
Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew
The sweet piano writing down my life'

'Teach me passion for I fear it's gone
Show me love, hold the lorn
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me
I'm sorry
Time will tell (this bitter farewell)
I live no more to shame nor me nor you
And you... I wish I didn't feel for you anymore...'

A lonely soul
An ocean soul 
Born from silence, silence full of it
A perfect concert my best friend
So much to live for, so much to die for
If only my heart had a home

Sing what you can't say
Forget what you can't play
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes
Walk within my poetry, this dying music
- My loveletter to nobody

Never sigh for better world
It's already composed, played and told
Every thought the music I write

A lonely soul
An ocean soul 
For whom the gun tolls
For whom the prey weeps
Bow before a war
Call it religion

Some wounds never heal
Some tears never will
Dry for the unkind
Cry for mankind

Even the dead cry
- Their only comfort
Kill your friend, I don't care
Orchid kids, blinded stare

Need to understand
No need to forgive
No truth no sense left to be followed

'Facing this unbearable fear like meeting an old friend'
'Time to die, poor mates, You made me what I am!'

'In this world of a million religions everyone prays the same way'

'Your praying is in vain It'll all be over soon'
'Father help me, save me a place by your side!'
'There is no god Our creed is but for ourselves'

'Not a hero unless you die Our species eat the wounded ones'

'Drunk with the blood of your victims
I do feel your pity-wanting pain,
Lust for fame, a deadly game'

'Run away with your impeccable kin!'

'- Good wombs hath borne bad sons...'
- Cursing, God, why?
Falling for every lie
Survivors' guilt
In us forevermore

15 candles
Redeemers of this world
Dwell in hypocrisy:
'How were we supposed to know'

4 pink ones
9 blue ones
2 black ones

For whom the gun tolls
For whom the prey weeps
Bow before a war

'Get away from me!
Take heed to thyself and see my face no more!
For in the day Thou see my face
Thou shalt die!'
Exodus 10:28

A constellation of divine architecture built on Earth
A holy harbour - Orion
Nautical ascension to the firmament

Ship-shaped barrows open my heart to the wisdom of this land
Sailing with the Serpent Chimera of a fiendish sandman

The Unicorn arrives with the westwind to dream His funeral
'Thou art born for Horus dwells in Thee'

Slumbering with the ebb and the flow of this foaming tomb
'Thou art born for Seteh dwells in Thee'

Reveal your face to me and guide me though the Stygian fields
Enthral my soul to Sepedet's beams to serve Your will

Sailing on the distant seas from darkness to deliverance
Tales like the ocean written to the Draco's glance

Ruling with the scythe of death you tear out philosophies apart
An ancient starwalk to merge into the stars

'Open thy veins for my venom
Kiss the cobras with thy twisted tongue
So shalt thou join the emryrean circus
Where beggars mourn and seraphs dance
In this twilight cathedral
Shall I wed thee,
O Bride of the Netherworld'

Join my soul the Hunter in the sky 
'Get away from me!
Take heed to thyself and see my face no more!
For in the day Thou see my face
Thou shalt die!'

'I was born amidst the purple waterfalls.
I was weak, yet not unblessed.
Dead to the world. Alive for the journey.
One night I dreamt a white rose withering,
A newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness.
I dreamt all my future. Relived my past.
A witnessed the beauty of the beast'

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?

I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of Man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path

'Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time,
Soon to be freed from care, from human pain.
My tale is the most bitter truth:
Time pays us but with earth & dust, and a dark, silent grave.
Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron,
Hope is only an illusion & Ocean Soul's nothing but a name...

Soon I will be here no more
You`ll hear the tale
Through my blood
Through my people
And the eagle`s cry
The bear within will never lay to rest

Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears

White man came
Saw the blessed land
We cared, you took
You fought, we lost
Not the war but an unfair fight
Sceneries painted beautiful in blood

Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

Our souls will join again the wild
Our home in peace `n war `n death

Wandering on Horizon Road...

I still dream every night
Of them wolves, them mustangs, those endless prairies
The restless winds over mountaintops
The unspoilt frontier of my kith n`kin
The hallowed land of the Great Spirit
I still believe
In every night
In every day
I am like the caribou
And you like the wolves that make me stronger
We never owed you anything
Our only debt is one life for our Mother
It was a good day to chant this song
For Her

Our spirit was here long before you
Long before us
And long will it be after your pride brings you to your end 
Soon I will be here no more
You`ll hear the tale
Through my blood
Through my people
And the eagle`s cry
The bear within will never lay to rest

This is me for forever
One of the lost ones
The one without a name
Without an honest heart
as compass

This is me for forever
One without a name
these lines the last endeavor
To find the missing lifeline

Oh how I wish
For sooting rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my
everything

My flower,withered between
The pages 2 and 3
The ones fnd forever bloom
gone with my sins

Walk the dark path
Sleep with angels
Call the past for help
Touch me with your love
And reveal me my true name

Oh how I wish
For sooting rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my
everything
Oh how I wish
For sooting rain
Oh how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore

Nemo sailing home
Nemo letiing go

Oh how I wish
For sooting rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my
everything
Oh how I wish
For sooting rain
Oh how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore 
Remember the first dance we shared?
Recall the night you melted my uglyness away?
The night you left with a kiss so kind
Only a scent of beauty left behind

Ah, dear friend I remember the night
The moon and the dreams we shared
Your trembling paw in my hand
Dreaming of that northern land
Touching me with a kiss of a beast

I know my dreams are made of you
Of you and only for you
Your ocean pulls me under
Your voice tears me asunder
Love me before the last petal falls

As a world without a glance
Of the ocean's fair expanse
Such the world would be
If no love did flow in thee
But as my heart is occupied
Your love to me now has to die
Forgive me, I need more than you can offer me

Didn't you read the tale
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?
Don't you know this tale
In which all I ever wanted
I'll never have
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

However cold the wind and rain
I'll be there to ease up your pain
However cruel the mirrors of sin
Remember, beauty is found within

...Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in you...

...Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in you... 
Toll no bell for me, Father
But let this cup of suffering pass from me
Send me no shepherd to heal my world
But the Angel - the dream foretold
Prayed more than thrice for You to see
The wolf of loneliness in me
....not my own will but Yours be done...

You wake up, where's the tomb?
Will Easter come, enter my room?
The lord weeps with me
But my tears fall for you

Another beauty
Loved by a Beast
Another tale of infinitely dreams
Your eyes they were my paradise
Your smile made my sun rise

Forgive me, for I don't know what I gain
Alone in this garden of pain
Enchantment has but one truth:
I weep to have what I fear to lose

'I knew you never before
I see you never more
But the love, the pain, the hope, o beautiful one
Have made you mine, 'till all my years are done'

Without you
The poetry within me is dead

'You tell me, my love; It's not love if it's not forever. But let me tell
You;
A Scene could be much more to remember than the play itself.'

With Wishes for you, in June '98

Today I killed, he was just a boy
Eight before him, I knew them all
In the fields a dying oath:
I'd kill them all to save my own

Cut me free, bleed with me, oh no
One by one, we will fall, down down
Pull the plug, end the pain, run'n fight for life
Hold on tight, this ain't my fight

Deliver me from this war
It's not for me it's because of you
Devil's instant my eternity
Obey to kill to save yourself

'I envy the 9 lives that gave me hell
My path made up by their torn bodies
Man to man, soldier to soldier, dust to dust
Call me a coward but I can't take it anymore'

They wait for me back home
The live with eyes turned away
They were the first ones to see
They are the last ones to bleed

'The ultimate high as all beautiful dies
A ruler's tool, priest's excuse, tyrant's delight...
I alone, the great white hunter
I'll march till the dawn brings me rest
10th patriot at the gallow's pole!'

Today I killed, he was just a boy
Eight before him, I knew them all
In the fields a dying oath:
I'd kill them all to save my own

Cut me free, bleed with me, oh no
One by one, we will fall, down down
Pull the plug, end the pain, run'n fight for life
Hold on tight, this ain't my fight

Deliver me from this war
It's not for me it's because of you
Devil's instant my eternity
Obey to kill to save yourself

'I envy the 9 lives that gave me hell
My path made up by their torn bodies
Man to man, soldier to soldier, dust to dust
Call me a coward but I can't take it anymore'

They wait for me back home
The live with eyes turned away
They were the first ones to see
They are the last ones to bleed

'The ultimate high as all beautiful dies
A ruler's tool, priest's excuse, tyrant's delight...
I alone, the great white hunter
I'll march till the dawn brings me rest
10th patriot at the gallow's pole!'

Godlove and rest my soul
With this sundown neverending
The feel is gone yet you ain`t gonna see me fail
I am the decadence of your world
I am an eider covered in oil
Happy hunting, you double-faced carnivore

Tell me why
No heart to cry
Hang me high

The music is dead, the amen is said
The kiss of faith is what I beg
A loving heart `n soul for sale

Tell me why...

Leave me be
And cease to tell me how to feel
To grieve, to shield myself from evil
Leave me be
Od of lies is killing me
Romanticide
Till love do me part

See me ruined by my own creations

Leave me be...

Dead Boy`s alive but without sense
I need a near-death experience
Heart once bold
Now turned to stone
Perfection my messenger from hell

Wine turns to water
Campfires freeze, loveletters burn
Romance is lost
Lord, let me be wrong in this pain

Temporary pain, eternal shame
To take part in this devil`s chess game
Spit on me, let go, get rid of me
And try to survive your stupidity

Who are you?
Man condemned to shine a salvation
Throughout the centuries
Why ?
Was the wine of the grail
Too sour for man to drink

The carpenter
Carved his anchor
On the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
Lay the tools of the one
Who for us had died
Tools of the carpenter

The one they lick
The same old sick
Dream of their precious saviour

Kiss them deep and
Make them weep
Over promises of eternal peace

The carpenter
Carved his anchor
On the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
Lay the tools of the one
Who for us has died

I hear you
Through the symphonic voices of nature
-the purity I could never doubt
They tell me to lie on the grass
And observe my saviour
The one crucified to the chirping of birds

Born to the false world, the wanderer,
Storyteller, The Pied Piper
On a quest for immortality
Gathering a troop to find the fantasy

Led by a maid - Queen of the night
Voice of angels, such a divine sight
An Amazon to fight and cure
This reality with her feline lure

Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream

Nightquest - quest not for the past
But for tomorrow to make it last
Simply the best way to walk this life
Hand in hand with the dreamers' minds
Enter the realm, don't stay awake
The dreams remain, they only brake
Forget the task, enjoy the ride
And follow us into the night

A merry minstrel with his fingers fast
Playing his lute, charming every lass
Joins the troop with a glitter in his eye
'Shall I find fame or shall I die'

A warrior of power along the path
A hammerheart, his gallantry to last
Rhythm of sirens, enemies, take heed
For in this war laws are a silent sleep

Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream 
Riddler, Riddler ask me why
The birds fly free on a mackerel sky
Ask me whither goes the winds
Whence the endlesstick-tick stream begins

Make me guess if the Earth is flat or round
Set a quessing if fantasies are unbound
If tale aren't just for children to see
That it's peace is sleep walks with me

As you wish
For kingdom come
The one to know all the answers
You think you dwell in wisdom's sea
Still, sweet ignorance is the key
To a poet's paradise
Challenge the Riddler and you will see

Riddler, Riddler ask me why
All mothers beneath the Earth and sky
Hold theait children's hands for a while
Their hearts forever... yours and mine

Make me wonder what's the meaning of life
What's the use to be born and then die
Make me guess who's the one
Behind the mask of Father and Son

For nature hates virginity
I wish to be touched
Not by the hands of where's and why's
But by the Ocean's minds

A nocturnal concerto
Candlelight whispers me where to go
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
Whilst I wander on this path of the night

Embroidery of the stars
Undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your salva to heal my scars
And let this nakedness be my birth

Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago
Has been heard by those
Who dwelled in a woe

The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved's land

Departed by the guillotine of death
I received a letter from the depth
The dream of my lover it carried inside

Caressed by the sharpest knife
I asked you to be my wife
Rays of the setting sun
Were my tears wept upon promises undone

Come to me
Make me believe
To you and your love again

Above the universe
Beneath the Great Eye
I shall desire you forevermore

Hearing music from the deepest forest
Songs as a seduction of sirens
The elf-folk is calling me

Tapio, Bearking, Ruler of the forest
Mielikki, Bluecloak, Healer of the ill and sad
Open the gate and let me follow the uncarven path

The way to the lands
Where as a hero I stand
The path where Beauty met the Beast
Elvenpath

It's the honesty of these worlds
Ruled by magic and mighty swords
That makes my soul long for the past
Elvenpath

The moonwitch took me to a ride on a broomstick
Introduced me to her old friend Home Gnome
Told me to keep the sauna warm for him

At the grove I met rest-the folk of my fantasies
Bilbo, Sparhawk, goblins and pixies,
Snowman, Willow, trolls and the seven dwarfs
The path goes forever on

As I return to my room
And as sleep takes me by my hand
Madrigals from the woods
Carry me to neverland
In this spellbound night
The world's an elvish sight

A single grain can tip the scale
Amidst the burden the scale will prevail
Showing what`s worth being here
Storyteller by a hearth of stone
A white little creature purring me
My childhood kingdom gone in time
The islands filling my mind with blue
The one in speacial, heaven`s court

All the joy unforgiven by this task

An errant soul, homeless and foul
All gone but the will to
Live to tell the tale

The days are filled with anxiety
Frustration, one right note a day
Where to find a perfect tune
Just do the work and take a step back

All the joy...

An errant soul...

Dark chambers of my mind
Locked around the neck of my love
None of you understand
And it doesn`t matter
To a broken marionette like me

An errant soul...

Oh how I hate mykind
Have it all
Yet wish to die

Not mykind but the kind as you are
Saints in Cain`s mask
I love you
I just did

A lonely bard wandering across the lands am I
Singing dancing finding answers to every why
The taverns are full and one crosses my path, too
I just might reward myself with a beer or two

This inn the place of many romantic tales
On the loft women offer their sales
But my eyes they catch a girl beat by everyone
A slave she is but for me a rose undone

Hear me sing
Watch me dance
Play that lute of thine
And share with me this dance

As she danced my eyes began to shine
There she was the maiden so divine
How could I approach her with my outlook so poor
Her beauty being much more than I could endure

So I asked if I could sing a chanson
With a language of ancient and of lore
Gathered the men around us me and the girl in rags
Soon were the melodies heard by everyone

Hear us sing
Watch us dance
Sing with us this tale

Master!
Apprentice!
Heartborne, 7th Seeker
Warrior!
Disciple!
In me the Wishmaster

Elbereth
Lorien

A dreamy-eyed child staring into night
On a journey to storyteller's mind
Whispers a wish speaks with the stars the words are silent in him
Distant sigh from a lonely heart
'I'll be with you soon, my Shalafi'
Grey Havens my destiny

Master!...

Silvara
Starbreeze

Sla-Mori the one known only by Him
To august realms, the sorcery within
If you hear the call of arcane lore,
Your world shall rest on Earth no more
A maiden elf calling with her cunning song
'Meet me at the Inn of Last Home'
Heartborne will find the way!

Master!...

Wishmaster
Crusade for Your will
A child, dreamfinder
The Apprentice becoming...

Master!... 
I want to see where the sirens sing
Hear how the wolves howl
Sail the dead calm waters of the Pacific

Dance in the fields of coral
Be blinded by the white
Discover the deepest jungle

I want to find The Secret Path
A bird delivered into my heart, so

It's not the end
Not the kingdom come
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer
Call of the wild
In me forever and ever and ever forever
Wanderlust

I want to love by the Blue Lagoon
Kiss under the waning moon
Straying, claiming my place in this mortal coil

Riding the dolphins
Asking the mountains
Dreaming Alaska
The Earth can have but Earth

I want to find...

It's not the end...

Look into my eyes and see the wanderer
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder 
Crownless again shall be the queen
Trophy on her grave still remains unseen
A boat on the river confessing the sins
The Riddler revealing the deep hidden things

Crownless again shall be the king
A gull covered in oil with a broken wing
A hitcher on a road alone and lost
Iron sharpens iron... - a truth that once was

Mine is the Earth and the sword in the stone
Mine is the throne for the idol
One fleeting moment and it is all gone
Crownless again
Will I fall?

Roaming on razor-sharp castles
Ruling all but myself
(Now my night is laid to sleep)

One fragrant rose worth ten times what I am
A crippled begging a coin braver than I ever was
Reflection from me-Devil dressed in white
Chasten the being
Become what I once was

Mine is the Earth... 
The days were brighter
Gardens more blooming
The nights had more hope
In their silence the wild was calling
Wishes were whispering
The time was there
But without a meaning

C h o r u s
Away, away in time
Every dream's a journey away
Away to a home away from care
Everywhere's just a journey away

The days departed
Gardens deserted
This frail world
My only rest?

The wild calls no more
Wishes so hollow
The Barefoot Boy
Weeping in an empty night

C h o r u s

Cherish the moment
Tower the skies
Don't let the dreamer
Fade to grey like grass

No falling for life
A gain for every loss
Time gathered me
But kept me flying

'For this gift of dream I must pay the price
with the loss of life's pleasures' 
We're walking in the air
We're floating in the moonlit sky
The people far below are sleeping as we fly

I'm holding very tight
I'm riding in the midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you

Far across the wold
The villages go by like trees
The rivers and the hills
The forest and the streams

Children gaze open mouth
Taken by suprise
Nobody down below believes their eyes

We're surfing in the air
We're swimming in the frozen sky
We're drifting over icy
Mountains floating by

Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep
Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep

We're walking in the air
We're floating in the midnight sky
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly 
We're walking in the air
We're floating in the moonlit sky

And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly 
An angelface smiles to me
Under a headline of tragedy
That smile used to give me warmth
Farewell - no words to say
Beside the cross on your grave
And those forever burning candles

Needed elsewhere
To remind us of the shortness of our time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows
Oh, Lord why
The angels fall first

Not relieved by thoughts of Shangri-La
Nor enlightened by lessons of Christ
I'll never understand the meaning of the right
Ignorance lead me into the light

Sing me a song
Of your beauty
Of your kingdom
Let the melodies of your harps
Caress those whom we still need

Yesterday we shook hands
My friend
Today a moonbeam lightens my path
My guardian 
An angelface smiles to me
Under a headline of tragedy
That smile used to give me warmth
Farewell - no words to say
Beside the cross on your grave
And those forever burning candles

To remind us of the shortness of our time

Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows
Oh, Lord why

Not relieved by thougts of Shangri-La
Nor enlightened by lessons of Christ
I'll never understand the meaning of the right
Ignorance lead me into the light

Sing me a song
Of your beauty
Of your kingdom
Let the melodies of your harps
Caress those whom we still need

Yesterday we shook hands
My friend
Today a moonbeam lightens my path
My guardian 
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I`m in love with my lust
Burning angelwings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight

Deep into a dying day
I took a step outside an innocent heart
Prepare to hate me fall when I may
This night will hurt you like never before

Old loves they die hard
Old lies they die harder

I wish...

I`m going down so frail `n cruel
Drunken disguise changes all the rules

Old loves...

I Wish...

Greatest thrill
Not to kill
But to have the prize of the night
Hypocrite
Wannabe friend
13th disciple who betrayed me for nothing!

Last dance, first kiss
Your touch my bliss
Beauty always comes with dark thoughts

I wish... 
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love

Denying the lying
A million children fighting
For lives in strife
For hope beyond the horizon

A dead world
A dark path
Not even crossroads to choose from
All the bloodred
Carpets before me
Behold this fair creation of God

My only wish to leave behind
All the days of the Earth
An everyday hell of my kingdom come

The 1st rock thrown again
Welcome to hell, little Saint
Mother Gaia in slaughter
Welcome to paradise, Soldier

My 1st cry neverending
All life is to fear for life
You fool, you wanderer
You challenged the gods and lost


Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
This world ain`t ready for The Ark
Mankind works in mysterious ways 
Denying the lying
A million children fighting
For lives in strife
For hope beyond the horizon

A dead world
A dark path
Not even crossroads to choose from
All the bloodred
Carpets before me
Behold this fair creation of God

My only wish to leave behind
All the days of the Earth
An everyday hell of my kingdom come

The 1st rock thrown again
Welcome to hell, little Saint
Mother Gaia in slaughter

You challenged the gods and lost

Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
This world ain`t ready for The Ark
Mankind works in mysterious ways 
Ever felt away with me
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day

Ever felt away without me
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me

Would you do it with me
Heal the scars and change the stars
Would you do it for me
Turn loose the heaven within

I'd take you away
Castaway on a lonely day
Bosom for a teary cheek
My song can but borrow your grace

Come out, come out wherever you are
So lost in your sea
Give in, give in for my touch
For my taste for my lust

Your beauty cascaded on me
In this white night fantasy

'All I ever craved were the two dreams I shared with you.
One I now have, will the other one ever dream remain.
For yours I truly wish to be.'


Naked in midwinter magic
Lies an angel in the snow
- The frozen ficure crossed by tracks of wolves
An encounter, symbolic, yet truthful
With a hungry choir of woods
An agreement immemorial to be born

Dulcet elvenharps from a dryad forest
Accompany all charming tunes
Of a sacrament by a campfire
A promise between the tameless
And the one with a tool
Tonight the journey from cave begins

I want to hunt with the tameless
I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar
We will honor the angel in the snow
We will make the streams for our children flow

Wrapped in furs beneath the northern lights
From my cave I watch the land untamed
And wonder is some becoming season
Will make the angel melt in shame

As the sun sets beyond the pyramids
To greet me with its rays
I place my hand on my forehead
To see your chariots' flames

Watch me kneel before you
Hear the cats meowing in the temple
They yearn the milk you cascaded
As I yearn that promised treasure

Treasure of
Tutankhamen
I am the one it is
Take me with you
Through the stargate
To the valley of the kings

Sacrifice me
Tutankhamen
And let me be your queen
Take me
Tonight and always
We'll breed to fill all earth

Three milleniums it took me to guard your rest
Your slumber in mighty Phoenix's nest
But tonight the darkness in the tomb has perished
For Carter has come to free my beloved

As the sun sets beyond the pyramids

Your slumber in mighty Phoenix's nest
But tonight the darkness in the tomb has perished
For Carter has come to free my beloved

You were my first love
The earth moving under me
Bedroom scent, beauty ardent
Distant shiver, heaven sent

I'm the snow on your lips
The freezing taste, the silvery sip
I'm the breath on your hair
The endless nightmare, devil's lair

Only so many times
I can say I long for you
The lily among the thorns
The prey among the wolves

Someday, I will feed a snake
Drink her venom, stay awake
With time all pain will fade
Through your memory I will wade

Barely cold in her grave
Barely warm in my bed
Settling for a draw tonight
Puppet girl, your strings are mine

This one is for you for you
Only for you
Just give in to it never think again
I feel for you
You were my first love
The earth moving under me
Bedroom scent, beauty ardent
Distant shiver, heaven sent

I'm the snow on your lips
The freezing taste, the silvery sip
I'm the breath on your hair
The endless nightmare, devil's lair

Only so many times
I can say I long for you
The lily among the thorns
The prey among the wolves

Someday, I will feed a snake
Drink her venom, stay awake
With time all pain will fade
Through your memory I will wade

Barely cold in her grave
Barely warm in my bed
Settling for a draw tonight
Puppet girl, your strings are mine

This one is for you for you
Only for you
Just give in to it never think again
I feel for you
Take heed, dear heart
Once apart, she can touch nor me nor you
Dressed as one
A wolf will betray a lamb

Lead astray the gazers
The razors on your seducing skin
In the meadow of sinful thoughts
Every flower's perfect

To paradise with pleasure haunted by fear

A sin for him
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin

I am the Fallen
You are what my sins enclose
Lust is not as creative
As its discovery

To paradise with pleasure haunted by fear

A sin for him...

Bless me, undress me
Pick your prey in a wicked way
God I must confess... I do envy the sinners 
Take heed, dear heart
Once apart, she can touch nor me nor you
Dressed as one
A wolf will betray a lamb

Lead astray the gazers
The razors on your seducing skin
In the meadow of sinful thoughts
Every flower's perfect

To paradise with pleasure haunted by fear

Once I had a dream
And this is it

Once there was a child`s dream
One night the clock struck twelve
The window open wide
Once there was a child`s heart
The age I learned to fly
And took a step outside

Once I knew all the tales
It`s time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
Once I wished for this night
Faith brought me here
It`s time to cut the rope and fly

Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago

The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me
This night will bring him back to me

Fly to a dream... 
Once I had a dream
And this is it

Once there was a child`s dream
One night the clock struck twelve
The window open wide
Once there was a child`s heart
The age I learned to fly
And took a step outside

Once I knew all the tales
It`s time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
Once I wished for this night
Faith brought me here
It`s time to cut the rope and fly

Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago

The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me
This night will bring him back to me

Fly to a dream... 
It is the end of all hope
To lose the child, the faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a birth

No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow

Angels, they fell first but I'm still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung

Wounded is the deer that leaps highest
And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug

Mandylion without a face
Deathwish without a prayer
End of hope
End of love
End of time
The rest is silence
It is the end of all hope
To lose the child, the faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a birth

No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow

Angels, they fell first but I'm still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung

Wounded is the deer that leaps highest
And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug

Mandylion without a face
Deathwish without a prayer
End of hope
End of love
End of time
The rest is silence
Sweet boy, come in
I am the dark side of you
Die for my sins
Like the One once did

Cinnamon bed
For your unashamed appetite
A figurante
This dance will hurt like hell

Oh, bare grace misery
Just a child without a fairytale am I
Dark but so lovely
A Little Match Girl freezing in the snow

Love lying, enticing
(Bare grace misery)
Crowning the moment
(Bare grace misery)
This is what I am
Bare grace for the end of days

Romantic scent
Spoiled Lucrece lies warm for you
There's no such priest
That can pray me to heaven

When done with me
Forget if you think I feel ashamed
A wild thing
Never felt sorry for anything

Love lying... 
Sweet boy, come in
I am the dark side of you
Die for my sins
Like the One once did

Cinnamon bed
For your unashamed appetite
A figurante
This dance will hurt like hell

Oh, bare grace misery
Just a child without a fairytale am I
Dark but so lovely
A Little Match Girl freezing in the snow

Love lying, enticing
(Bare grace misery)
Crowning the moment
(Bare grace misery)
This is what I am
Bare grace for the end of days

Romantic scent
Spoiled Lucrece lies warm for you
There's no such priest
That can pray me to heaven

When done with me
Forget if you think I feel ashamed
A wild thing
Never felt sorry for anything

Love lying... 
The story behind the painting I drew is already told
No more tearstains on the pages of my diary
Tired but unable to give up since I`m
Responsible for the lives I saved

The play is done
The curtain`s down

All the tales are told
All the orchids gone
Lost in my own world
Now I care for dead gardens

My song is little worth anymore
Time to lay this weary pen aside

The play is done
The curtain`s down

Where are the wolves, the underwater moon
The elvenpath, the haven of youth
Lagoons of the starlit sea

Have I felt enough for one man`s deed?
Or is it time to challenge the Ancient of Days
And let the virgin conceive

All the tales...
The story behind the painting I drew is already told

All the tales...
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

The child gave thought to the poet's world
Gave comfort to the Fallen
(Heartfelt, lovelorn)

Remaining, yet still uninvited
Those words scented my soul
(Lonely soul, Ocean soul)

It's not the monsters under your bed
It is the Man next door
That makes you fear, makes you cry,
Makes you cry for the child
All the wars are fought among those lonely men
Unarmed, unscarred

I don't want to die a scarless man
A lonely soul
(Tell me now what to do)

I studied silence to learn the music
I joined the sinful to regain innocence

Heaven queen, cover me
In all that blue

All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

The child gave thought to the poet's world
Gave comfort to the Fallen
(Heartfelt, lovelorn)

Remaining, yet still uninvited
Those words scented my soul
(Lonely soul, Ocean soul)

It's not the monsters under your bed
It is the Man next door
That makes you fear, makes you cry,
Makes you cry for the child
All the wars are fought among those lonely men
Unarmed, unscarred

I don't want to die a scarless man
A lonely soul
(Tell me now what to do)

I studied silence to learn the music
I joined the sinful to regain innocence

Heaven queen, cover me
In all that blue

Time it took the most of me
And left me with no key
To unlock the chest of remedy
Mother, the pain ain`t hurting me
But the love that I feel
When you hold me near

The hopes were high
The choirs were vast
Now my dreams are left to live through you

Red Sun rising
Drown without inhaling
Within, the dark holds hard
Red Sun rising
Curtain falling
Higher than hope my cure lies

Passiontide
An angel by my side
But no Christ to end this war
To deliver my soul from the sword
Hope has shown me a scenery
Paradise poetry
With first snow I`ll be gone

The hopes were high...

Red Sun rising...

Your death saved me

Red Sun rising... 
Time it took the most of me
And left me with no key
To unlock the chest of remedy
Mother, the pain ain`t hurting me
But the love that I feel
When you hold me near

The hopes were high
The choirs were vast
Now my dreams are left to live through you

Red Sun rising
Drown without inhaling
Within, the dark holds hard
Red Sun rising
Curtain falling
Higher than hope my cure lies

Passiontide
An angel by my side
But no Christ to end this war
To deliver my soul from the sword
Hope has shown me a scenery
Paradise poetry
With first snow I`ll be gone

The hopes were high...

Red Sun rising...

Your death saved me

Red Sun rising... 
The sun is sleeping quietly
Once upon a century
Wistful oceans calm and red
Ardent caresses laid to rest
For my dreams I hold my life
For wishes I behold my nights
A truth at the end of time
Losing faith makes a crime

I wish for this night-time to last for a life-time
The darkness around me - shores of a solar sea
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun
Sleeping
Weeping
With you

Sorrow has a human heart
From my God it will depart
I`d sail before a thousand moons
Never finding where to go
222 days of light
Will be desired by a night
A moment for the poet`s play
Until there`s nothing left to say

I wish for... 
The sun is sleeping quietly

A star falls down from the darkened sky
Where new worlds born and die
Kingdom Animalia watches its approaching glow
What it means is soon to be known

Beneath the lovely birch honeymakers build their nest in peace
On the savannah a lion licks a wounded gnu
To honor this moment even the heavens cease
Giant spiders learn how to swim
With whales they form a united kin

Snakes say hello to the rats on the ground
In the meadows play merrily the fox and the hound

Trilobite & Anymalocharis
The prey and the hunter
Survival of the fittest
Fall of Man

Seadrops foam all empty human skulls 
A star falls down from the darkened sky
Where new worlds born and die
Kingdom Animalia watches its approaching glow
What it means is soon to be known

Beneath the lovely birch honeymakers build their nest in peace
On the savannah a lion licks a wounded gnu
To honor this moment even the heavens cease
Giant spiders learn how to swim
With whales they form a united kin

Snakes say hello to the rats on the ground
In the meadows play merrily the fox and the hound

Trilobite & Anymalocharis
The prey and the hunter
Survival of the fittest
Fall of Man

Seadrops foam all empty human skulls 
Sleep Eden sleep
My fallen son
Slumber in peace

Cease the pain
Life's just in vain
For us to gain
Nothing but all the same

No healing hand
For your disease
Drinking scorn like water
Cascading with my tears

Beneath the candle bed
Two saddened angels-in heaven, in death

Now let us lie
Sad we lived sad we die
Even in your pride
I never blamed you

A mother's love
Is a sacrifice
Together sleeping
Keeping it all

No sympathy
No eternity
One light for each undeserved tear

Beneath the candle bed
Two souls with everything yet to be said 
Sleep Eden sleep
My fallen son
Slumber in peace

Cease the pain
Life's just in vain
For us to gain
Nothing but all the same

No healing hand
For your disease
Drinking scorn like water
Cascading with my tears

Beneath the candle bed
Two saddened angels-in heaven, in death

Now let us lie
Sad we lived sad we die
Even in your pride
I never blamed you

A mother's love
Is a sacrifice
Together sleeping
Keeping it all

No sympathy
No eternity
One light for each undeserved tear

Beneath the candle bed
Two souls with everything yet to be said 
Come wet a widow's eye
Cover the night with your love
Dry the rain from my beaten face
Drink the wine the red sweet taste of mine

Come cover me with you
For the thrill
Till you will take me in
Come comfort me in you
Young love must
Live twice only for us

For me
For you
Time devours passion's beauty
With me
With you
In war for the love of you
(Tonight any dream will do)

Not a world but your fine grace
Seduction in sleepwalker's land
November dressed in May on your face
Holding us now the lovecropper's hand

Come cover me... 
Come wet a widow's eye
Cover the night with your love
Dry the rain from my beaten face
Drink the wine the red sweet taste of mine

Come cover me with you
For the thrill
Till you will take me in
Come comfort me in you
Young love must
Live twice only for us

For me
For you
Time devours passion's beauty
With me
With you
In war for the love of you
(Tonight any dream will do)

Not a world but your fine grace
Seduction in sleepwalker's land
November dressed in May on your face
Holding us now the lovecropper's hand

Come cover me... 
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and your/my voice 
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and your/my voice 
Close your eyes
Feel the ocean where passion lies
Silently the senses
Abandon all defences

The place between sleep and awake
End of innocence
Unending masquerade
That's where I'll wait for you

Hold me, near you
So closely, sear you
Seeing, believing
Dreaming, deceiving

The place...

Sleepwalker seducing me
I dared to enter your ecstacy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you're mine to keep

Sleepwalker

Sleepwalker seduc ing me
I dared to enter your ecstacy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you're mine to keep 
Close your eyes
Feel the ocean where passion lies
Silently the senses
Abandon all defences

The place between sleep and awake
End of innocence
Unending masquerade
That's where I'll wait for you

Hold me, near you
So closely, sear you
Seeing, believing
Dreaming, deceiving

The place...

Sleepwalker seducing me
I dared to enter your ecstacy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you're mine to keep

Sleepwalker

Sleepwalker seduc ing me
I dared to enter your ecstacy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you're mine to keep 
All those beautiful people
I want to have them all
All those porcelain models
If only I could make them fall

Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above

A wintry eve
Once upon a tale
An Ugly Duckling
Lost in a verse
Of a sparrow's carol
Dreaming the stars

Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above

In my world
Love is for poets
Never the famous balcony scene
Just a dying faith
On a heaven's gate

Crystal pond awaits the lorn
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born 
One more night
To bear this nightmare
What more do I have to say

Crying for me was never worth a tear
My lonely soul is only filled with fear

Long hours of loneliness
Between me and the sea

Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wished to be - one with the waves
Ocean Soul

Walking the tideline
I hear your name
Is angels wispering
Something so beautiful it hurts

I only wished to become something beautiful
Through my music, through my silent devotion 
In your creation heaven did decree
That in your arms sweet death should dwell

Deep Silent Complete
Black velvet sea
The sirens are calling for me

Saved my soul thinking 'This song's a lie'
Sand on the shore is so dry

Deep Silent Complete
Black velvet sea
Brave day sinking in endless night

The age will say 'This poet lies'
Heaven never touched earthly face
The age will say 'This night was ours'
Blessed with the Deep
The Silent the Complete
In your creation heaven did decree
That in your arms sweet death should dwell

Deep Silent Complete
Black velvet sea
The sirens are calling for me

Saved my soul thinking 'This song's a lie'
Sand on the shore is so dry

Deep Silent Complete
Black velvet sea
Brave day sinking in endless night

The age will say 'This poet lies'
Heaven never touched earthly face
The age will say 'This night was ours'
Blessed with the Deep
The Silent the Complete

I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed
You bathed in my wine
Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds

Put a stake through my heart!
And drag me into sunlight
So awake for your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer

Swan song for the Wish of Night
God it hurts, give a name to the pain 
I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed
You bathed in my wine
Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds

Put a stake through my heart!
And drag me into sunlight
So awake for your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer

Swan song for the Wish of Night
God it hurts, give a name to the pain 
Trees have dropped their leaves,
Clouds their waters
All this burden is killing me

Distance is covering your way,
Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me

Oh, do you care,
I still feel for you
So aware,
What should be lost is there

I fear I will never find anyone
I know my greatest pain is yet to come
Will we find each other in the dark
My long lost love 
Trees have dropped their leaves,
Clouds their waters
All this burden is killing me

Distance is covering your way,
Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me

Oh, do you care,
I still feel for you
So aware,
What should be lost is there

I fear I will never find anyone
I know my greatest pain is yet to come
Will we find each other in the dark
My long lost love 
The scent of a woman was not mine...

Welcome home, darling
Did you miss me?
Wish to dwell in dear love?

Touch my milklike skin
Feel the ocean
Lick my deepest
Hear the starry choir

Rip off this lace
That keeps me imprisoned
But beware the enchantment
For my eroticism is your oblivion

Old love lies deep, you said
Deeper shall be the wound between your legs 
The scent of a woman was not mine...

Welcome home, darling
Did you miss me?
Wish to dwell in dear love?

Touch my milklike skin
Feel the ocean
Lick my deepest
Hear the starry choir

Rip off this lace
That keeps me imprisoned
But beware the enchantment
For my eroticism is your oblivion

Old love lies deep, you said
Deeper shall be the wound between your legs 

Imagine a perfect beach
Without a mermaid
Imagine a perfect hideaway
Without a time

Ocean Soul

Imagine a perfect Eden
Without a friend without a serpent

Ocean Soul
Lonely Soul

'Feeling lonely and content at the same time,
I believe,
Is a rare kind of happiness'

Ocean Soul
Lonely Soul 
Fare thee well, little broken heart
Downcast eyes, lifetime loneliness

Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone

Constant longing for the perfect soul
Unwashed scenery forever gone

No love left in me
No eyes to see the heaven beside me
My time is yet to come
So I'll be forever yours

Fare thee well, little broken heart
Downcast eyes, lifetime loneliness

Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone

Constant longing for the perfect soul
Unwashed scenery forever gone

No love left in me
No eyes to see the heaven beside me
My time is yet to come
So I'll be forever yours

'Oh, sweet Christabel. Share with me your poem.
For I know now, I'm a puppet on this silent stage show.
I'm but a poet who failed his best play.
A Dead Boy, who failed to write an ending
To each of his poems.' 

Safely away from the world
In a dream, timeless domain
A child, dreamy eyed,
Mother's mirror, father's pride

I wish I could come back to you 

Safely away from the world
In a dream, timeless domain
A child, dreamy eyed,
Mother's mirror, father's pride

I wish I could come back to you
