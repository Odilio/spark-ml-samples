If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go darling
Maybe it's better that way
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Just walk out that door
Yea see if i care
Go ona dn go now but

Don't turn around cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around, i don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go but i won't let you know

I won't miss your arms around me holding me tight
If you ever think about me
Just know that i'll be alright
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
I know i'll survive
Sure i'll make it through
And i'll even learn to live without you

Don't turn around cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around, i don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go but i won't let you know

I wish i could scream out loud that i love you
I wish i could say to you 'don't go'
As he walks away he feels the pain getting strong
People in your life they don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around he's gone

Don't turn around cause you're see my heart breaking
Don't turn around, i don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go but i won't let you know 
One step hesitation
One step into the night
Don't mind the weather
It's raining in my heart tonight
Much more to living
Two wrongs don't make a right
You're gonna regret it
When you're looking back
On your life
Don't go away
Make the most of this love I'm giving
Don't go away
Better take another look at my face
You can be what you wanna be,
But don't go away
Some dream of fortune
Others dream of fame
Seconds after leaving
Life'll never be the same
Fell for temptation
It didn't mean a thing
We'll last forever
If you turn around
Once again
Don't go away
Make the most of this love I'm giving
Don't go away
Better take another look at my face
You can be what you wanna be,
But don't go away
Wanna be more than a picture hanging on the wall
Something to remind me how it all went wrong
Do you wanna be more than a number forgotten in a book
You're holding something special so take another look
You're gonna regret it
When you're looking back
On your life
Don't go away
Make the most of this love I'm giving
Don't go away
Better take another look at my face
You can be what you wanna be,
But don't go away
Take a look
Take a look
Take another look on you way
Take a look
Take a look
Take another look on you way
Take a look
Take a look
Take another look on you way (please don't go)
Take a look
Take a look
Take another look on you way (please don't go) 
I see dark clouds out my window
I know the storm is coming any minute
And the thunder just confirms my fears
And I know the tears are in it
I'll be cryin unable to stop
Look here comes the very first drop
'Cuz every time it rains
I fall to pieces
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you
I taste you
I cannot forget
Every time it rains
I get wet
Darlin I am still in love with you
As time passes by it just intensifies
I know I'll never be with you again
I'll never find another with that kindness in his eyes
I'll be trying unable to stop
Look here comes the very first drop
'Cuz every time it rains
I fall to pieces
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you
I taste you
I cannot forget
Every time it rains
I get wet
On sunny days I'm all right
I walk in the light
And I try not to think about
The love I live without
But every time it rains
I fall to pieces
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you
I taste you
I cannot forget
Every time it rains
I get wet
'Cuz every time it rains (every time it rains)
I fall to pieces (every memory)
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you
I taste you
I cannot forget
Every time it rains (every time it rains)
I get wet
'Cuz every time it rains (every time it rains)
I fall to pieces (every memory)
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you
I taste you
I cannot forget
Every time it rains (every time it rains)
I get wet 

When I was young
I dreamed about Oh so many places
When I was young I never thought
Id be afraid
The years go by and with it comes
Oh so many changes

You know what I mean?

Can't you hear them whispering
Around you all the time
Can't you tell the difference between
Things when you're in love
I hear your voice is trembling
Every time when he's around
Your detached engagements
In the things I say means love, oh
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad
If he doesn't love you, you're afraid that you
Can't go on
Living without loving never makes a person
Strong, no
If he really loves you, let him show you that
Instead
I will be here with you 'cause I know that
You're afraid of love
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad
You'll never change my mind my friend, don't
Let that feeling go
This love might change your world around
In time you'll have to know, oh yeah
Whether you should go
Oh yeah
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides whether you should smile
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be sad
Whether you should be happy
Whether you should cry
Whether you should be happy
He decides
Whether you
I know that
He decides 
This is a song about a well known girl
Who was she
We will never know the answer to that question
Cecilia -walk in the light
Cecilia -you're gonna live forever
According to a well known song
Cecilia -walk in the light
Cecilia -did you come home and to whom
Simon and Garfunkel had a little problem
It was something about their hearts you used to break
Them and make them go down on their knees
On and on again
Cecilia -walk in the light
Cecilia -you're gonna live forever
According to a well known song
Cecilia -walk in the light
Cecilia -did you come home and to whom
Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they
Were a single pair not free like you
Still they got a tragical end
So many years ago life in itself can't hurt
Cecilia -walk in the light
Cecilia -did you come home and to whom
Passion changes but they will still remember you
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today
We will never know the answer to that question
Cecilia -walk in the light
Cecilia -you're gonna live forever
According to a well known song
Cecilia -walk in the light
Cecilia -did you come home and to whom
I've been trying to overcome the mental blocks I've got
If they loved you why didn't you respond to all their pleas
I wonder

My deja vu...you're my obsession

My deja vu everything is up to you
If you do want me you know where to search
We'll get the magic back again
My deja vu everything is up to you
If you do want me you know where to search

I wanna see you dancing naked, I wanna see you touch the moon
But when I try to reach your fingers, you just vanish to air
I wanna feel you with my senses,
'Cause I'm almost sure the texture of your skin
Is gonna tell me who you are

My deja vu, you're my obsession
My deja vu, it's always you


I wanna hold you like I used to, I wanna feel you in my blood
I wonder why I do confess this, to myself all the time
I know the time is working against us,
But I'll long for you the rest of my whole life
Like a prisoner of hope

My deja vu, you're my obsession
My deja vu, it's always you

I have tried to get to know you, to get you off my mind
It feels like going back in time
And snap, I see your figure once again

My deja vu, everything is up to you
If you do want me you know where to search

My deja vu, you're my obsession
My deja vu, it's always you
My deja vu, you're my obsession... 
What a beautiful morning
The best in life is free

What a beautiful morning
Believe me

What a mystery
Though the world's on fire
Yesterday's hard words is still in my head
I feel no despair
No regrets or sorrows
Cause this new day
Makes me dance on air

What a golden day

What a beautiful morning in my life
The best in life is free
I give it all away
And I wonder what more is to come
And this beautiful morning changed my mind
Believe me when I say
The shadows fading out

As the day grows bright
We are turning pages
And we write new chapters of our life
Some are strong and long
Others weak with sorrows
Keep the focus on the rising sun

What a golden day

What a beautiful morning in my life
The best in life is free
I give it all away
And I wonder what more is to come
And this beautiful morning changed my mind
Believe me when I say
Shadows fading out

Believe me - crows will always fly
Believe me - they are only birds
You have to
You have to let go and you will see things in a different light

What a beautiful morning
What a beautiful morning
Believe me

What a beautiful
What a beautiful morning...

Believe me

Blonde
In the summer time, yeah
In the summer time, life was easy
On the beach you had him long ago

I just wanna be here beside you

And stay until the break of dawn

Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child
Such a dream, oh oh oh

I just wanna be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn

You're looking for somewhere to belong
You're standing all alone
For someone to guide you on your way
Now and forever

We're living in different ways
It's a beautiful life
I'm gonna take you to a place
I've never been before oh yeah
It's a beautiful life
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away
With you tonight

Let me turn all the tears that you have cried into pearls
Hand them over to me, I'm gonna keep, keep them for you

I want to hold you, I want to kiss you
She wonders if she'll ever get away

I want to mend what is broken
Love me the way that you loved her - please

'Cause now, I'm giving it all

And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be yours this time
I'm gonna give what I've got, and get your love in return
And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be yours this time
I'm gonna teach you to trust, and learn how to burn
Experience Pearls

Pearls of Experience

When sand strikes up in your eyes, I will cover your face
I'll plant your desert with roses, and I'm gonna keep, keep them for you


I'll wear your pearls more precious than silver
I'll wear your pearls so close to my skin
I'd tear myself apart just to get you


What an odd situation
What you got is basic emotions
Can you feel them
I wan't to be your lover
But you're so shy
What you need is perfect assistance
Let me guide you
To a land you're never seen before

I guess you see
I have another daydream
I guess you see
That I have another daydream

Come and be a dancer
Dance into my daydream
Join me in my daydream wet and wild

Come and be a dancer
Dance into my daydream
Join me in my jungle wet and wild

To help another person
Will make you feel important
You got my invitation
But you're so shy
Come and let your wild side show
And be a dancer
A dancer in a daydream we can share

I guess you see ...

Help me take control
Of my full imagination
I'm looking for a man
Who will watch my situation
I'm thinking about the people
Waiting down the line
I am the limelight now's my time

I guess you see...

What you gonna do I'm a bold explosion 
Hey darling
Have to tell 'bout the world
Have to tell you today
Believe me now
Believe me now

You'd better believe in angels
There's no other substitute
We all do that before we're going up in the sky
If your loving is in your money
Know they cannot hug you back
This is the sound of the world
I know, I say, I do, I say

Hey darling
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world
Hey darling
Why don't you see
You gonna twist and curl
Take a look around
Take a look around

You're going to be burned out
You must blame it on yourself
You're burning your candles both ways
That I've learned from my past
Quench your thirst with memories
There's no point in being stressed
That is the thing I have learned
I've done, I've been, I've seen all that

Hey darling
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world
Hey darling 
If you walk in the red light at night
In the black velvet hour
If you look you will see their delight
They're the purest of flowers

They've got love for sale
The money they earn when everybody wants them
Money for pleasure, pleasure and pain
They've got love for sale

Money and sex, addicted to drugs
Pleasure and pain - together they walk
Money and sex, addicted to drugs
Pleasure and pain - together they walk

What they get is addicted to drugs
To ease all their sorrows
What they get is addicted to drugs
To ease all their sorrows

They've got love for sale
The money they earn when everybody wants them
Money for pleasure, pleasure and pain
They've got love for sale

Illusions for your mind
They are just illusions for your mind ??

They've got love for sale
The money they earn when everybody wants them
Money for pleasure, pleasure and pain
They've got love for sale

I'm driving through the night, I'm driving through the rain
The engine roars, I'm on my way from Mr. Pain
My eyes keep seeing what my mind wants to forger
Those sequences, they Rock 'N' Roll inside my head
Over and over and over again, I concentrate harder and harder and then
You are just and image (that I can't see)
You are not for real, you turn into a picture of somebody
Someone I don't know, Someone I don't feel

The wolves cry out tonight, I see your broken line
The sun will rise without a love without a smile
I always think about the way you had to leave
I close my eyes, 'cause I was with you by that time

Faster and faster and faster ahead, as if you were waiting
For me down the way
I have never seen you lying on a floor, crying, needing more

She leeds a lonely life - she leeds a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day has just begun
She opened her eyes and thought
O' what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby

All that she wants - all that she wants

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever
It's a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of that is flashing on her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants ...

You're living in a dreamer's dream
Da Da Capo

One level ahead
I'm calling to you
But touch you I cannot do
To tell you i can't
I'm drawing the line
To greetings to understand

You will find me waiting out in the dark
I'm your everlasting property
You're the one I'm living for
And feed all the time

Da Da Capo
Once again
I'm telling you I am your friend
But you can't hear me in your dream
You're living in a dreamer's dream
Da Da Capo
Gone with the wind I am not
And I visit you too a lot
Passing the gridlock
Is a hard thing to do

I'm longing to see
The offspring of me
To hold it with my bare hands
So talk about me as you used to do
I'm with you from time to time

You will find me waiting out in the dark
I'm your everlasting property 
(Buddha/John Ballard/StoneStream)
Fire! I can see it burning so brightly
Fire! I can feel it calling out to me

And as the sun goes down
It starts to paint a picture of an ancient town
So far away, across the endless sea

Lead me to the light and take me to the edge of heaven
I'm standing in the night looking for the edge of heaven
We'll be touching the edge of heaven

Give me just a minute to shine with you
I will make you so happy, make you laugh

Time
Close your eyes and see dreams of tomorrow
Time
The wheel are turning till eternity

And as the darkness comes I start to see a picture
Of a lonely man, so clearly now reaching out to me


And sail the endless sea
So lead me to the light and take me to the edge of heaven

The edge of heaven is near
We'll sail the endless sea 
(Joker)
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down,
I'm always here like a sun

I'm a loser, that is a fact for sure
I'm happy even if you don't want to invite me out for a dance tonight
I'm not normal, I know it, I don't care


I'm always here like a sun, I'm always here

Like a ghost I follow your steps so true
You don't have to bribe me or fill me up
Give me just a minute to shine with you
I will make you so happy, make you laugh

I'm never gonna say I'm sorry, for the essence of my soul
There's so many ways to change my life
'Cause I want to...oooh
I'm like a clown, I am fun for everyone
I'm like a clown, I am fun for everyone

Life is paradise

Oooh yeah!

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight (2nd time )I'm a prisoner of hope I
Know

I believe life could be paradise once again
And the love we thought we lost in sleeping within
Close your eyes, it's something for you


We are young and we are old we're fallen like leaves
And your heart's so full of soul it makes me believe
Once again, it's something for you


The bridge over time was what she need to see the light
To see the light whoo yeah

Tonight we're really gonna have a good time
Oh we're really gonna have a good time

Tonight we're really gonna have a good time
Oh we're really gonna have a good time

Confess you look at her
Confess you'd like to be with her
Confess you look at her
Confesss you'd like to be with her
Confess!
Confess you'd like to be

Baby blue-eyed Connie Walker

You'll lose her you'll lose her

Blue-eyed Connie Walker

Do it do it you'll do it

Dance yourself mad

You'll like it
You'll like it
Fashion party

We're gonna have a really good time 
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I&#180;m living for the light
Don't cry for me today, ah-ah ah...

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind......

I cannot be your judge
Mr. Jailer is your host
He's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye
Can help you from yourself

Please Mr. Agony
Release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of
Living without life

We live in a free world... (repeat & fade) 
Laudate omnes gentes laudate
Magnificat in secula
Et anima mea laudate
Magnificat in secula

Happy nation living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of the perfect man
A situation leading to sweet salvation
For the people for the good
For mankind brotherhood

We're travelling in time

Ideas by man are only that will last
And over time we've learned from the past
That no man's fit to rule the world alone
A man will die but not his ideas

Happy nation...

We're travelling in time
Travelling in time

Tell them we've gone too far
Tell them we've gone too far
Happy nation come through
And I will dance with you
Happy nation

Happy nation... 

Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want, you can live in a dream
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down

You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You're making your own decisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me
So many people just running around and 'round
Without no sense of logic

I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger, woohhh, you'll be living in danger

People are the same today as they used to be, the same expectations
So high no one can reach that high, not I nor you get satisfied today
We'll never get enough

I know that I'm not the first one
You've had love in your path before me
But when your lips touched my lips it felt
Like I was kissing destiny

Angel eyes, with you/your angel eyes
Will you always be there to hold me
Angel eyes, I am satisfied, I don't want to hear you're story
'Case I can see the things I really want to see
I'm in love/In your eyes

I believe in what I'm feeling
I'd give everything up just for you
Love is devoted to those who see
That the last dance, you dance with the truth


Angel eyes, I just want you hear to hold me

Reality Reality Reality is always

You tattooed yourself what a piece of art
You've already broke your mother's heart
When I was your age working my ass off
You're generation's soft


Reality is always such a drag for barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming 18 wants to know,
What's keeping her from searching/hiding in the shadows

You cannot pierce that and you're dressed too tight
Gotta lot to learn 'bout wrong and right
So dye your hair, dad's gonna wash it out, come on wash your mouth

Reality Reality Reality Reality is always

Just chaos!

Maybe he liked to brag
Did he invent himself
He lives till the end of time

Oh m&nchhausen was a son of a gun
He had his share of wild adventures
He rode the cannonball like no other man
And pulled himself up in the air

Just chaos!

Whether he liked to brag
He lives till the end of time
With his immortal lies

Oh munchausen took a trip to the moon
And beat the sultan and his navy
With a company containing just five
He gunned them down just by himself

Such a special man baron munchausen
He spread chaos around the world

Just chaos!
Maybe he liked... 
Ace of base is in your mind, io! dance...

Everyone everywhere, everyone everywhere
Ace of base is in your mind

You're giving me hope, I'm moving back in time
You're giving me hope, I'm moving back in time

Everyone everywhere, dance or fade out!

In my mind, in my mind, in my mind, in my mind, you live

You're giving me hope (me hope)
I'm moving back in time
I'm moving - I'm moving 
Change with the light

Change with the light
Turn, turn, turn around
Change with the light
Change with the light

Smile on my face
Like doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
I'm changing
I change with the light
Hiding away running from reality
Who am I
Am a doctor in this game

Aaah

Change with the light
Turn, turn, turn around
Be my baby
Stay for the night
Do it right
Feel my vibrations 
Always have, always will
I was mesmerised when I first met you
Wouldn't let myself believe 
We wanna be alone tonight
'til early in the morning light
