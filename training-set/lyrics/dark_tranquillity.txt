Force it to begin
Spark the flame
To fire-bursting sin
Doctrine denied
Over and over again

Keeping death of all things private
Expose this failed creation
What is done is dead
What is done is dead

To be content, an abomination
Are you satisfied
Are you done with this

The ultimate rebellion
The sacrifice is endless
The ultimate rebellion
Be nothing to no one

What's in a true life?
Behind the crumbling walls
Of dream and infant illusion
Action without movement
Desire without heart
It is over and done
It is over and done
To crave for touchless objects
And fathom without eyes
The fall of all things personal
That no one sees

The ultimate rebellion
The sacrifice is endless
The ultimate rebellion
Leave nothing to no one

Awaken to the screams
Of unresolved
Demands and accusations
Words are free

No, these are the outer symptoms
Of inner detonation
They will force us to inaction
Rid us of resolve
Take the burden off me
Lead me to my grave

The ultimate rebellion
The sacrifice is endless
The ultimate rebellion
Leave nothing to no one

Dreamt up a new word today
With my ignorance I gave it meaning
Who was I to know?
To say it is to know it
To hear it is to believe, is to believe

I dreamt the world would end
I was not wrong
To doubt, to discredit
The other words I've heard before
From inside a shell pretending

It's all you've shown your faith
And what you've always known
So lay your trust in the unthinkable
It's time to justify your lesser faith

It's all your faith has shown
And all you'll ever know
Why do you matter, you're insignificant
How can you justify your lesser faith?

Oh!
To know it is to fear it
To feel it is to say no, is to say no
To the blazing highs and lows
I know I'll fail
To break, to cast it down
You take your lead
From a staff that must be broken in two

It's all your faith has shown
And all you'll ever know
Why do you matter, you're insignificant
How can you justify your lesser faith?

This is a ghost town
Alive with the echoes of failures fled
Lit up by shining faces
That parade these streets
What used to be
Of humility is gone
You walk the mounds
Of skull and bone
Where living is denied
I see more movement in decomposition
Than in those hollow eyes

It is the only place I know
Where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie
That death is most alive

Set flame to the ensnarers
And pierce that ornate shield
Branded by what claims you
You wear the mark of death
Tear from loss and agony
A character defined
Stripped of all but tragedy
What life is left to find
Go now—until there's nothing left
Go now—the dying has begun

It is the only place I know
Where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie
That death is most alive

So I flee from all that is me
To hide behind this pale dead face
Whatever happened to desire, want and need
Whatever happened to integrity
Imagination is a curse in all of this
Whatever happened to the ones left behind

This is a ghost town
Bodies dragged through endless streets
Go now, to never return
I see more pitiful humiliation
Than you could never hide

No, it is the only place I know
Where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie
That death is most alive

I tell you here
Of all the crimes and hours broken
What never came, will never be the same
Uh, I tell you this, I tell you what

The mind that has been flooded
All the exits sealed
A poison set to enter
The unforgiving me

Probes and infiltrators
Infiltrate me

It's in these hours we forget ourselves (forget ourselves)
Within a fire that consumes itself (consumes itself)… Go

No need for your defences
My angerwall will hold
Take your steady pride
In monotony and beat

Invaders and corruptors
Invade me

It's in these hours we forget ourselves (forget ourselves)
And never again (never again)
Within a fire that consumes itself (consumes itself)

A super nova of flame on fire
This broken spirit, blind at heart

Bite down hard on frustration
The siege that can't be broken
This hollow flame of fear
Uh, I tell you this, I tell you what

So close without connection
Locked inside the sphere
I take the blame upon me
And scream at what I see

I'm blind at heart
So blind at heart

It's in these hour we forget ourselves (forget ourselves)
And never again (never again)
Within a fire that consumes itself (consumes itself)

Like lust has yet to fail me
No power to subside
My instincts never broken
This downfall so close at hand

The thing that scares me most
Is the fear I see in others
And the thing that really
Frightens me to the core
Is when I see that fear in you

Like shields against the action
No enemy to subdue
We barricade forever
The which hides inside of us all

The thing that scares me the most
Is the fear I see in others
The thing that really
Frightens me to the core
Is when I see that fear in you

To break the rules and patterns
Are you scared enough?
Before the end is here
Are you scared enough?

Are you scared enough?
Are you scared enough?

The thing that scares me most
Is the fear I see in others
That look that sends shivers
Down my spine
Will haunt me to the end
Of living days and nights
You're the thing that matters to me most
And I sense this fear in you

Inside the particle storm
Where clouds of napalm shimmer
With the promise of one final dawn

Inside the particle bliss
Where ages collide into nothingness
Obliteration's one final kiss

A claw in the garden of eden
Clogging the bloodstream of Earth
Tearing a hole in the fabric of life
The horizon enriched with scars

Inside the particle blaze
A chamber of dissolution
Proclaiming the end of days

We leave now
Nothing will follow, nothing at all
The cleansing flames of entropy
To devour us all

Our lungs are filled with sarin
Our children drowning like dogs
Handcuffed to the weight of cold dark matter
Without purpose, meaning or name

Inside the particle storm
The poison gene of humanity
Nullified

This is the moment
When black ships anchor to the skies
The heavy hands of chaos
Descend in merciless demise

What night never abandoned
In shallow darkness dwell
The evidence in pools of black
Light cannot penetrate, light cannot penetrate

Uh, have you come for my forgiveness?
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Lifted from the living days
To be bent right out of shape
Let blades and satisfires
Cut and lick these wounds
In reversal of repentance
This bastard son of lies
To bring meaning to it all, meaning to it all

Uh, have you come for my forgiveness?
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Take now from this body
A coward's heart
And a soul beyond repair
Empty me

Between insecurity and reason
Self deprecation as a means to the end
Out of reach but never closer
A cure that searches for the cause of this
Cause for chaos

Uh, have you come for my forgiveness?
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Drawn from memories the fragments linger
On ages of thought and seconds of sleep
What is it here that tempts the night
To stab the day and kill the light

All has now been broken
On streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion
I build my fences high
If there was something out there
I've learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons
Not to care

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

As always in these matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons
Never to share again

This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

This is how it all begins

Come now
Come now
Come now

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

I think, I just forgot
To pick up the shells
From my recent discharge
And you took the blame
Explanations falter
To ears fallen deaf
Wherever I go—I get lost

A reference to something
That both of us knew
Nothing that favors the few
In the darkness electric we see
That silence has spoken tonight

I think, I have lost my language
Whatever I've said, I deny
I think, I have lost my way
Whatever was missing is gone
I let my focus shift

Your face is a map
I fail to discover
Drowning the sounds
So lost in the order
It's the look that stayed my words
The unblinking knowledge
Interlocked and holding
No stalemate to break
Take hold of the flame that unites
In the silence that speaks to me now

I think, I have lost my language
Whatever I've said, I deny
I think, I have lost my way
Whatever was missing is gone
I let my focus shift

I struggle to find the words
That negate my meaning
I fail to comprehend
What message is given

I decline the steady hand
That leads to rejection
Tempted by the closure
With no sense of pride
Drown the fury and swallow the fire
Drown the fury, swallow the fire

I think, I have lost my language
Whatever I've said, I deny
I think, I have lost my way
Whatever was missing is gone
I let my focus shift

Seen through these dreamless eyes
Blind buildings stark to the sky
Silhouettes as dividing walls
Guarding the eternal secret
Where is the flame to haunt you
Who do you answer to
My lies are always wishes
Lies that make me
See beyond the rationale
Accept the fate that nothing is meant to be
Be the least connected
Stay true to the last original

Apply layers to reality
Things only you can see
Add a beat to normality
To tap the core of insanity

I let my dreams cross over
To days of endless grey
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
We'd forge the new unknown
I let my dreams cross over
To nothingness and back again
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
Where is the dark I came to find?

In latter days as time will find you
Memories will never let you get closer
The silent sighs in useless company
Wish for darkness and death again
In the face of ignorance and fear
I cast it right back
Some things were never there to begin with
Objectivity is truth denied

Apply layers to reality
Things only you can see
Add a beat to normality
To tap the core of insanity

I let my dreams cross over
To days of endless grey
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
We'd forge the new unknown
I let my dreams cross over
To nothingness and back again
If I could merge the mundane and the magic
Where is the dark I came to find

As in the life of rain
You're only alive when you're falling
The coldest chill
In the emptiness of reason

You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
With nothing to gain
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
It begins today

So light up the days
With the darkest of waking dreams
For endless puzzles
To reflect our aim

You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
With nothing to gain
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
It starts today

It seems you've passed the mark
Of indescribable dark
I fear you've drowned
In hope of what you think will come

Extracted from the sharpest of moments
Built to greet you when the time will come
Empty spaces on foundations of denial
Your structure is dust

As in the death of dream
Awakenings will leave you stranded
Where no one is listening
Where no one is around

You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
With nothing to gain
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
It begins today

I don't mind the fall
It's the climb from the bottom
That hurts the most
Here today
A stab of emptiness
Divert your eyes
From the judgemental stares
So non-forgiving
Yet what do they know
And what have they seen
I cannot do it

I plunge myself against these rocks of ice
Go!
Hell-driven hounds now on my trail

To play a part
Uphold a bland facade
Do the expected
If only nothing remained
Of facts and furies
These are the seconds
That will not be forgotten
This is the time
What have I done
What do they know
I cannot do it

I plunge myself against these rocks of ice
Go!
Hell-driven hounds now on my trail

Eyes on the prize
Yet never tell them
In shadows hide it
What eyes can tell
How well you know
Familiar urges
Is the same old place
Where you will know it
And they will pay
They will pay

Hell-driven hounds now on my trail
I plunge myself against these rocks of ice

We are delusional
To go against mortality
Still we fight, love and create
As the only creatures
In on life's grand secret
We sense the pointlessness beyond

There is a void between our hands
That drown the sounds of night
An arrow laced with liquid darkness
For every sungods heart

It has always been right here
Like a shadow in our blood
It waits for you and me
The shadow in our blood

We are delusional
From fictional reality
To prayers for prosperity
Loneliness
Can we resist your pale attraction
Give in to the dream with open eyes

How will this world within a world live on
Another page torn from the book of strangers
Who says "I" when all voices fear their own sound
And who remembers the hours

It has always been right here
Like a shadow in our blood
It waits for you and me
The shadow in our blood

Here in the barren and still
Far from the shores of real
Dreams borne beyond borders
On weave of thought and want
Here were invincible

It has always been right here
Like a shadow in our blood
It waits for you and me
The shadow in our blood

He takes a stand
And looks his enemy in the eye
This goes no further

I have the upper hand
This ends on my terms
I challenge non-existence
Every single day

The end of mind
End of freedom
End of everything

A most violent event
Breaks individuality
And turns out your shadow

In devastating light
That push against our eye
Dance to the bloodsong
In dream oblivion

He makes a point
Of sticking to the lie

This is the last time
I'm now done with this
I carry my nothing
Every single day

The end of mind
End of freedom
End of everything

Now with reality on end
The fall of all morality
Dance to the bloodsong

In devastating light
That push against our eye
Dance to the bloodsong
In dream oblivion

The end of faith
End of meaning
End of everthing

Eventually they'll come
Your name has been called
Out for aeons
To claim the blood
And salvage what remains

For once we've seen the fragile nature
Of things behind these windows
Where nothing lives
And nothing ends

And seen what drives the hopeless
In between their closing yellowed walls

The day has come
You are the fatalist
The day has come
You are the fatalist
You walk on soil that dreams of blood

How can we fight fatigue?
In pre-historic sorrow?
When all is preordained
The cycle never ends

What once had been an endless realm
Of possibility and dream
Now laid to waste and ruin
Laid to waste again
You wash your hands in blood

You squander time
We borrow from eternity
Is it another lame excuse?

The day has come
You are the fatalist
The day has come
You are the fatalist
You walk on soil that dreams of blood

You are the fatalist

If nothing changes
Then nothing ends

Your thoughts are broken
Your reasoning is flawed
The defense is just an act
And lies are all you've got

You are the fatalist
You are the fatalist

How easy we can see?
Defeat behind your argument
The fatalistic smile

The day has come
You are the fatalist
The day has come
You are the fatalist
You walk on soil that dreams of blood

The day has come
The day has come
You walk the ground that screams for murder

Eyes that meet to say farewell
And linger through the sleepless nights
A trail of days that end in tears
But I can never be there

The rush of hours that never seem to end
What life has dealt you can not comprehend
I am the absentee

I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see through your eyes,
I'm right here

How could I have known what preceded your own thoughts
Wish that I could listen to what only speaks inside
Every raging dissonance
Each jarring note
But I could never be there

How could you think that I would understand
When words just go around what the heart truly wants?
I am the absentee

I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see through your eyes,
I'm right here

I want to tell you,
Of the exploding light
How everything is visible
Moments before the dark

I am never, never there

I know you're out there searching tonight
Another day and I'm not there

Thrust with nails of conflict
Anxiety and pain
Through spells of anger, confusion and defeat
I wish you'd see me here in front of you,
But I am not here

I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see though your eyes

I know your out there,
But I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see though your eyes,
Lead me right

What if you are an island of sorrow
Then I'll be the raging sea
What if you are the reaching trees
Then I'll be the storm that with fire rages

The new loneliness
Your name on the door
Just like a diagnose
For venomous disease

Man is the cemetery for unlived life
All for nought
The grand accusation

Your face is your name
Word and shield
Sharp as a curse

Man is the cemetery for unlived life
All for nought
The grand accusation

You chose rejection
Over thoughts of insight
You take action
From focus on intent
And brace for impact
Not waiting for the fall

What cries here, cries inside
Man is the cemetery of unlived life
The grand accusation

What if you were a country of grief
With me the invading force
What if you were to measure the hollow
That captivates and devours you

The new loneliness
Your name on the door
Just like a diagnose
For venomous disease

Man is the cemetery for unlived life
All for nought

Do not hide your sorrow,
Or banish it from sight
Take it out to burn,
Turn the pain against it

In a day, that holds no other
What are we? The fuel or the flame?
In a life, that hides behind you
What are you? The fuel or the flame?

In the proud momentum,
Thrust the hand from the start
Our fragile fate falls apart

I hear you in my echo,
A few steps behind
I see you in my shadow, waiting inside

What if we don't question the meaning of it all
The answer in our system
Bound to kill the spark

The moments so illusive
One dream never ends
Scorns the doubting nomads
That burn another trail

In a day that holds no other
What are we? The fuel or the flame?
In the life, that hides behind you
What are you?

The shine of trembling stars,
Out in the distant
Curse this lack of site,
Into darkness without end

In a day that holds no other
What are we? The fuel or the flame?
In a life that hides behind you
What are you? The fuel or the flame?

In a day that holds no other
What are we?
In a life that hides behind you
What are you? What are you?

Why do I see her, the never ending nights?
Why do I see her, wearing nothing but the dark?

Have you come here to warn me
Of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something
But you do not have the words

I know where you live
I can see through your darkness
And when you sleep
I hear a heart that beats you

Have you come here to warn me
Of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something
But you do not have the words

Eyes far into the distance
A life that does not connect
Time played well its part
On the strings that bind us

Encounters in silence
Words elude the freeing night
Wish I could fathom
What is too hard to tell

Her head hangs low
In the silence of her room
Her head hangs low
She takes a bite out of her heart

Have you come here to warn me
Of what I cannot see
You want to tell me something
But you do not have the words

Held by winter's chokehold fast
Fixed in axiety's firm grip
The frost that burned the arteries

Underneath the heavy clouds
The lifted sword, the broken shield
The hand that drew the final word
From the frozen mouth of Arkhangelsk

Let them go, let them burn the world to cinders
Let their heads hang down
Falling through the tungsten skies
The burning grounds of Arkhangelsk

To the eye of judgement now
One will stand in time of the end (time of the end)?

Sun to stone, air to fire
All to nothing and nothing to nil
They gather, drowning in the sounds
Of the grinding wheels of Arkhangelsk

With one word, one movement in the fabric
Everything dies
The storm that sweeps the world away
From the frozen plains of Arkhangelsk

Inherit from the morning star
What others brought
And the land forgot

Soaring through van allen belts
Through blazing stars, through dying suns
Collide not now, but carry us
Through the burning air of Arkhangelsk

Drink this water again
That runs by without memory
Where your name is lost
Drink and forget yourself
This featureless stream
That carries your face further on
These waters know you
It calls you by your one true name

Have you ever noticed
The spaces in-between
Where life is in recession
And agony begins?

I am the call
I speak inside of you
I am the void
That haunts you
I am the howl
That calls you out
I am the void
I am the... void!

You rest your weary head
On to the underworld
And let the silent whispers
Guide your waking dreams
In time with the pulse
Of what is long since gone
The beat of the fallen
Is cold already in your blood

The machinery of chaos
Comes alive in you
Chained to the grinding wheel
Of forces unseen

I am the call
I speak inside of you
I am the void
That haunts you
I am the howl
That calls you out
I am the void
I am the... void!
I am the void!

You have always been between another set of walls
Outside of which the world is watching down on you
Inside the silence speaks
Kept close to the endless alibi
Never reaching out
Never give in

I am the call
I speak inside of you
I am the void
That haunts you
I am the howl
That calls you out
I am the void
I am the void

It starts below
The pile and the burning in the
Darkness in the recipe
And fire in the soul
To paralyze and strangle hold

Disable the design
The remnants of reality
In our measured time
Is torn apart

We carry our fear inside,
A space that hold the darkness
We stretch our skin around,
To cover the abyss

The smirk on our reality
At the future we foresee
Blood that seeks redemption
In endless nights of sin
Spades without spears
That pierce the blinding sun

We heard from the heralds of grief
That nothing remains

We carry our fear inside,
A space that hold the darkness
We stretch our skin around,
To cover the abyss

Breaks into day
Upsets the system
It's in our nature to bear
The hidden to the end

What if this feeling contains the truth?
What if our dreams give way to the dogma of old?
What if lost desire can be found?

No shelter, no barriers between what's already inside
Betrays what the surface holds

We wear our lives
On waters and dust
Like daemons of the lost
Still wrapped in our own confusion,
The call of the abyss

We carry our fear inside,
A space that hold the darkness
We stretch our skin around,
To cover the abyss

Let the horizon lead
Onto the ether of the night
Draped across the burning heavens
Flying homeward like a bird of the soul

Shattered into a million brighter stars
Each flare unique and rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creation's core
An end beyond compare
Iridium

Now is the time to leave
We lie awake, we stand afire
At the edge of the world
Above a myriad of light
Below the mantle of the stars
And strangely they fall

Shattered into a million brighter stars
Each flare unique and rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creation's core
An end beyond compare
Iridium

Shattered into a million brighter stars
Each flare unique and rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creation's core
An end beyond compare
An end beyond compare
Iridium

Heeey
What is your life about today?

A pit of emptiness
A close resemblance
To what you thought was right or wrong
You don't belong
The face you hold is false

Drawn to the darkest emotions
Sworn to the vortex of grief
Disguised as empathy
It's not supposed to be
I know you're faking it
So take a look around

Zero distance
From where do you see yourself?
Zero distance
How far are you willing to go?

A broken perspective
That you impose on the innocent
Your fallen set of standards

You go beyond what is decisively human
Take from others what you do not have
What you cannot own
Wear the mask
Be the mask

You hide behind
You're not supposed to see
I know you're faking it
So take a look around

Zero distance
From where do you see yourself?
Zero distance
How far are you willing to go?

Zero distance
Can you see what I see?
Zero distance
How far are you already gone?

To the end of what you fear
Take a hold of that outmost misery

Oh!

I want to see you show
Disgust for sympathy
Honour and bravery
I know you're faking it
So take a look around

Zero distance
From where do you see yourself?
Zero distance
How far are you willing to go?

Each and every night
My heart shoulders the armour
And charges into the dark
To slay what took you from me
But there in the eye of the prey
I see my reflection
The armour now shatters to pieces
Until I hear the call again

Alone I set out to find you
Below the timeline
Alone and far from the stars
I walk out of gravity

As lightning scorns the night
And conspires with the sunken seas
Out there are hunters of the invisible
Tacking mere dust for days
On cracked soil now they walk
On ground that has lost it's hold

Alone I set out o find you
Below the timeline
Alone and far from the stars
I walk the nether paths

In void-like silence
Through veins of man
A new disease breaks our ground
By venomous sorrow's hand

It caught me by surprise
The sudden weight of my own blood
Gravitate towards the end
A pull that offers no option

So steep my longing
I give in to vertigo
Whipping of cold black tongues
Poisons my wounds

Alone I set out o find you
Below the timeline
Alone and far from the stars
I walk out of gravity

We throw ourselves
Like rocks against the heavens
To call to us attention
And set our sights for higher ground

Weaved within the nervous system
Of our planet and the vows we keep
The dormant fragments
Of self-destructing code

Into the emptiness
Where fires cannot feed
No way to hold
The burden of love alive

We nod at each other from across the open plain grave
And go to memories to visit our own lives

We hide in the bodies of greater beings
Together as one in the face of endless trials

You carry my life
Inside you my only witness
Our hands held against
In suffering

Into the emptiness
Where fires cannot feed
No way to hold
The burden of love alive

the print you left 
bear just witness 
to the forceful push 
with which you thrust yourself 
out from this world 
your own very being
launched away from this 
temporary hold

you are never gone
the letters of your name
a scar that never heals

so be the bow and the arrow
be the rope and the angered scream
as time now eats away
at the unmarked graves
and indifferent winds take speed
over lands of uncertainty
to hold what can be held
against the coming dark

in the minds of the hollow
hollowed out
your words rang once so true

you are never gone
the letters of your name
a scar that never heals
you are never gone
for you are ours now
we hold you in our hearts

there are still tremors
the occasional sparks
a voice unheard
from the empty void (you left behind)

we can still feel it
your body turned loose in the darkness
grief as the razor
within these walls of skin
to the end of forever
to the end

you are never gone
the letters of your name
a scar that never heals

so be the bow and the arrow
be the rope and the angered scream
you are never gone
as indifferent winds take speed
over lands of uncertainty
you are never gone

No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie

It twists and turns
Into something that is not to be
What truth is left
Was abandoned as the lines flew by

Our words are broken
Commit to sacrifice
Betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness
No truth, no lie

Our words are broken

Our subconscious bias
Confirmed what we already believe
There is no message
There is no value
We give shelter to our false ideas

Commit to sacrifice
Betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness

Tear our thoughts into splinters
Stab the sense
That's forced to remember
Our words get thrown
Out of focus
As we test our will
Dissolve to nothing

Break all bounds of unfair holding
Track this line to journey's end
We're breaking
We're breaking down

Our words are broken
Commit to sacrifice
Betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness
No truth, no lie

...our sacrifice
...betray the code
...into nothingness

To connect
And make sense of it all
We draw lines
Through the chaos within
We measure what is everything but real
On a crooked scale

Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
The science of noise

Fill in the blanks
And avert the gaze
Descend upon
Those who trespass against us

Torn from the sheltering safety of faith
As crooked as they come

Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
The science of noise

One clear cut line
That separates it all

We challenge the void
To bare it secret beyond

We look until we see
What our truth now will be

Now
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
The science of noise

It all comes out
In desire we forgot to face
Take down ambition
Or in our minds we will always fail

The faceless remember
The hours and the fallen words
Connect the fallacies
Detect autonomy
There is a limit
To the never ending sky

We must come to terms
Admit we are defeated
We must come to terms
Of bias and deception
Stand up and be counted
In uniformity

It sets a high mark
For what our minds can endure

Is there life in the distance
A faint beacon of light
Let us fall to the inner ceiling
Of everything we see

The endless resistance
Decides upon the fallen words
Direct the agony to a non response
And forgiveness to an idealized mirage

It informs all decisions
And challenges us to dare

Exaggerate what the words wont say
Build and argument against yourself

Sit this one out
In the silent treatment

The walls are coming down
All we need is
One to fail, one to break
One to take it all away
What if we crumble,
What if we fall
Where is the flame
That torch the soul
Truth when spoken
Dies down to nothing

We challenged light and flame,
And settled for the dark
With pressure built to a point
Deflated before its time
We set our world on fire
Yet lost the will to burn
Not set a tone but a distance
The silence in between
Whatever validates
The anger kept inside

Nothing ties the world to me
Not a page of history
Cannot talk the pain away
Nothing tie the world to me

The silent treatment gets to me
So few and far between
These great dividing acts
Behind those silent eyes

Take the loss to heart
A new beginning
Start anew
Apocalyptic bliss
Lost to the hours
Bare essential needs
Succumb to this
Non-reality

Sometimes I feel
What silence best describes
Sometimes I feel
Apathetic to this life
Turn your back
On helpless failures past
Awakening
Shut the mind
To equal parts of nothing
Reality now
Wicked
The sense of nothing lost
Will of the steerless ones

Face away
From the garish light of day
Remembering
Something I supposed
To have believed
Reality now
Face away?

So after all that has been said
Can we find a way back to when
The days were ours to take
And nothing ever hurt,
And we failed to offer or forgive?

Reach out for the favors
Take down the hopeful light
For even the broken, even the broken break

In the silence that only you know
What hides in the emptiness that only you know?
When the night is long and the will is weak
Even the broken break.

It is a pain you will never know
Held up to a light you once shone
For every hour in my head the mind distorts
So what can the broken ever say?

Phase out the noise pollution
Tune out of insanity's dream
Take the hopeless, take the hopeless down

In the silence that only you know
What hides in the emptiness that only you know?

In that darkness that only you know
In the silence that only you know
What hides in the emptiness that only you know?

You burned the ruin
The torched remains
And set the precedent
Of innocence betrayed

With the coming of our ages
Will the chasm clear
To identify the pieces
And gather what is lost

The hours feel so different
Yet everything's the same
The hours feel so different

Now bring it out into the open
Full disclosure now
Bring it out so we can
Start all over again
Take another stab at honesty
Full disclosure now
Get it done so we can
Start all over again

Righting the imbalance
In a difference of hearts
Close to breakage
Soon to fall
Fought the urge
To carry through
Held on to the real
Sacrifice the ego
Sacrifice the I

It changes the perception
And alters disbelief
It changes the perception

Like a crack in the clean slate
I see emotion take over the rational
We are the favoured sons of reason
With tools at our disposal
Squandered day by day

Strip the thoughts
Heal the system
Take the original back
It is inside me/now
If this is all I can remember
Can I ever trust myself

Like a flash or a fleeting glance
I see movement in the corner of my eye
Now the mind goes into overdrive
To process and deceive
How will I ever know

Give up the experience
To halt the fictional mind
It is inside me/now
Block out all that makes it painful
Set the pieces back in place

If this is all that I remember, can I ever trust myself

I track movement
Like light behind my eyes
Made to match up
With what I tell myself each day
My experience
Is what I do not know
And one I cannot trust

It infects the marrow
A virus of ideas
It is inside me/now
What my mind is telling me
Must come undone

If this is all that I remember, can I ever trust myself

I feel the silence come
In rooms I now detest
The chill of the touch
In infinite night
I thought I had it

One life
One fear
Too much to handle/for one to handle
Too much to take

I held it as my own
And took for granted
What I "knew"

Come inside
To what the darkness pushed away
Set out to find me
The cold of the thought
In infinite touch
The switch gets thrown

What are we missing here
What have we been told
We must be the shield
And not the sword

This life was thrown
Out to the elements for failure
This life was over before it had its time
The distance blurred the edges
And sickened the resolve
Our overturned perception
Held forgotten virtues true

We failed to hold our promise
Of never letting go
The doubt is now inoperable
As faith is to the blind
Man-made virus of deception
We must vaccinate the mind
Alter our climate
Tune the world to our will

The dust has settled in
The broken structure
Is now one with
This shattered beauty
In timeless indifference
Become one, become none

The upturned soil, the reversed sky
Mock with promise of our last hope
Skybound in our will
We seep beneath the surface layer
Become one, become none

Between the white and the black
Where the grey interacts
Within the margin of reason and lies
A line must be drawn

Fear of an opposing
Thought is ours
Ages upon ages of distrust
Feed the war machine
That’s in our minds
Fundamental truths
Now set aside
Territorial immemorial

The anger attached to the bone
Digs in deep and poisons the core
The scorn of the nefarious scribe
Must be heard through the ages

Tune the instrument to reasons light
Measure what is equal, what is right
The venom spreads itself
Through thought and word
Boundless and protective
At the core
Territorial immemorial

Break momentum again
The forces of will is upon us
If man is the measure
Then anything goes

Draw from and interpret the absurd
Borne on antiquated lost ideals
From the oppressor
To the blinded prisoner
Our goals are just the same
Territorial immemorial
