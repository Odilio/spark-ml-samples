She brought the Night hidden in her sad Wolf eyes
The perfume of a twilight, her strongest scent
Half Wolf, Half female - what a strange wedding
Mother Nature has offered us to see...

Her mask lays lost in a fatal dawn
Closed were the eyes of the Sun. He sleeps.
And in the name of Her Father.
She will kill. My child kills.

You nightly birth. A requiem God can't forget.
For your life is just a celebration of his death
Without his thorns in her heart. She wears a shadow as face.
A werewolf masquerade. In her eyes the wolfshade.

She brought the Night and by the night was brought
We are but children of the powers she had set free
Strange are the ways of the wolfhearted...

The cold nights have awakened Me
The soft winds to undress Me
The nails of two witches hav touched Me
Their caress cuts like the sharpest ice

Yes it is their way, this so mysterious way
of welcoming Me, welcoming Me
Their way to remember
Distant nights of Passion and Doom
Where, naked, have I bathed in velvet waters
Witnessed by an accomplice smile inside an innocent Moon

Serene were the beings who guided Me
Empty were the hands which undresses Me
To carve strange symbols unknown to Me
but lay so dearly inside of Me

This is my way, this so mysterious way
of welcoming She, welcoming She
My way to remember
Distant nights of Passion and Doom
Where we both wore flesh crowns to defy
The skies in their blue and so vague tyranny

We are mute villains
drinking of Love as insolent Vampires
Valsing through stars and skies
at that and all to come Winter nights

Like neophyte ravens in the strangest nest
Charmed by the wilderness of this strange host
Drawing naivety with our blood and semen
Ritually engraved in our hearts and chests
Marks of a pain, signs of a love crime
That will forever and never last

It is our way, this so mysterious way of loving
of welcoming thee, welcoming thee
Our way to remember
Forever lost nights of Passion and Doom
Remembrance served in cups .of sorrow and pride
For all the eternities we'll still cry
For having lost amidst the stars our bride
Untouchable in her smile, inside the great Silver Eye
Every night she is condemned to shine

You've no mother to feed you
or to lick your so deep wounds
nor Earth where to lay your timid crown
You've suffered by your father
and even the Moon lies to you
When she shines...

The seduction of an altar
Is a weakness in her movements of Death
It is a mere vanity of Woman
to delay her midnight ride
Suicide... Midnight ride...

Beautiful dagger you may now leave your case
Wild red tears at the lady's hand
Kissed were her breasts with your sharpened face
Given is now what Love had taken
death and Love, they together danced

Yes, the flames did smile to her
Invited her to their fiery peace
To a funebre dance around a bonfire
Where all Women are naked and alone
Immolating their pride
May they forever ride. Far, in a midnight crime.
Midnight Ride, Suicide, Midnight Ride...

Vampiria, you are my destiny
My only Love and true destiny
Vampiria...

You're a beast, evil one
Above your head lays a Star
In your heart is buried the jewel
of a Serpent who wished to die
your red long tongue has her poison
And you will spread it as you breed
In a Unique transylvanian dream
Conceiving the creed of all creeds

Vampiria, fly Vampiria

In your eye burn, defying
All those who in silence sleep
In a city once named Desire
Dreaming with the entombed dear

The lady has fallen in a blossom
Spread far away by undesirable winds
To females conspiring in gloom
Hiding your pearls from the pigs

So open your arms!
They were shaped as wings
A serenade of revenge draw on your lips

The sombre hill you're staying in
Is now defined
And your Star had start to shine

Depart now on your bright wings
The world envy
The skies have always seduced you
Precious Queen
and you know your time has come
To fly away with Me, so far...

Queen of all my sleepless nights
For whose beauty I, Faun
have played my pipes, with heart
Queen in white silk, skin like milk
Horns of Faun, lips of dawn
You are now honoured you with my presence
As I'm honoured by your sight
I crown your perfection
The predator in your breast, I devour

Tempted is now my light body

From where it burns spirals of exotic scents
Rose, sandal, jasmine, all kinds of incense
Aged fragrances only dreamed of once
Dragons do dream far beyond the sense
We make love in the dusty throne
of a Modern Sodoma

"Come to Me, step further into my nakedness
Caress me in your breasts of Fire"

"Breed my flame, have no fear or weakness
I welcome you in my hole of desire"

"Have me now, Prince, have me here"
Your beg still whispers in my ear

Daylight has broken into a strange nostalgia
Night tired candles seem like two lovers
Melt in a embrace of conspiracy
Between us there is this strange chemistry
but would you die for me?
would you die for what I've longed to be?

"Imperious, choleric, irascible, extreme in everything, with a
dissolute imagination of the like which has never been seen,
atheistic to the point of fanaticism, there you have me in a nutshell
and kill me again or take me as I am,
for I shall not change."
De Sade

"Breed of a nameless force, origin of our Sin
We are as large as Gods, we are their tragedy
We are the four arms of the solar Cross
Lightning in incredulous faces the flames of Uthopy"

Would you die for this?

Mother Tongue speaks to Me
In the strongest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in Me
Her proudest child, her purest breed

She speaks to Me in colours
That I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
And to those I'll proudly bend

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the Power within.

For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
World can't you see it?
Am I alone in my belief?

ALMA MATER!

Breaking waves announce my Bride
It is the only way the Sea could sing
Legends of Lusitanian pride
He sings the words I cannot spring

At the Moon Mountain six wolves cry
Your lost glory we'll regain or die

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest mystery
Pagan Gods in conspiracy
For the sword of Tyranny

Mother Tongue has spoke to thee
In the strongest way they've ever seen
World can't you see?
I am not alone in my belief.

ALMA MATER!

ALMA MATER!

Mother Tongue has spoke to Me
In the strongest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in Me
Her proudest child, her purest breed

She speaks to Me in colours
I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
and to those I'll proudly bend

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the powers within.

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest tragedy
World can't you see it?
I am not alone in my belief.

Opium, desire or will?
Inspiration bound from an elegant seed
Subversion, through smoke I foresee
Erotic motions of lesser gods in ecstasy

Opium, bring me forth another dream
Spawn worlds of flesh and red,
little jewels of atrocity
Opium, I sleep in debauchery
And burn with you
when you burn in Me

Opium, we fantasize
as we fuse with your root
You are a strange flower,
we are your strangest fruit

Opium, it burns in me and you
Opium, it burns for me and for you

Awake... for all is dying, even the dead

We are our Past failing to come back

All of us visionaires
with a rope around our neck

Your honey on coil burns,
As tears drop from your grand dead womb

Undesired, I fell into your being
Releasing shapes inside of you
Only seen in your wildest dreams
I am the impossibility
of your long-kept chastity
I am your offence and you can't wait
To have me inside of you and taste...

Eternity

Revolving around me,
in desire, you burn
As blood drops
from your new-awakened womb

Undesired, and thrown away from your belief
I am the one whom you
were taught to renounce
In your virginal fear
The sweat, the hands, the sleepless nights
And the violence of the silent sighs
All of them gather in me
Take my hand and taste eternity
Take my hand and find a new god

In each of your failures
I saw my victory
And each time you fall
A knife tattoos a smile
On my lips
You are now empty of life
And we are drunk with death

Raw models
Ruin & Misery

I can offer you a hand
To help you hold the dagger
A perfect jewel for
Our perfect end

And as we lay, we kissed
Fingers wet with poison
Thinking to each one
There is beauty in death

Raw models
Ruin & Misery

Allow me to doubt
We were lovers who could really share
The only love between us
Was hate

Without hope we could not fear
And silently we disappeared
Hand in hand, we took our lives
And together stopped being
Raw models on a novel of Ruin & Misery

Forever young in a ground so cold
The splendor of your death still fresh to behold

In your neck an open wound
To spawn life into your Love
And to feed the creatures of our world

We have tasted from the poisoned gift of love
Which condemned us to forever fly alone

We have experienced an aged potion
The wine of life which stole us light
May we gather again and be as one
And to forever relish in the twin joys

As we taste from the poisoned gift of love

Forever young in a ground so cold
The splendour of your dance still there to behold

Our legend is a sin in tongues
To eternal sleep, to trance we belong
We are now but an empty glance
Palid is your state of grace

To eternal sleep we belong
Feeling the rapture of the world
Beneath the violence of this curse
From the poisoned gift of love

Once I asked you to fly
Tonight I recreate the vow:
Do not fail to love Me as I have failed to die
With you...

Perverse: the religion of pain
In each detail a world,
I know you hide something...

I remember her as a child

Raven...on and on with her raven claws
Carving...on and on with her raven claws

How she lusts when she remembers
The night of her first blow
She always wanted to know
How far could she really go

Inflamed, a dead-end room
Seduce to consume
Nightsilence...Vampire...Empire
Statues with open wounds

The flavour of poison and moon
Still maturing on her blood
She is not your occasional affair, no!
But eternal love, drop by drop...

Raven...on and on with her raven claws
Carving...on and on with her raven claws

How daylight hurts when moonlight bites
She juggles with her invisible knife
A black bird senses danger and flies
Gives peace to a tall figure in the dark

Little silhouette snakes find
a warm nest behind the door
And whip-tongues and skins
of sisters now gone.

Bodyprints cover the velvet floor
Which grows red and red
They know she will hunt and hurt tonight
And they crown her Queen of the Dead.

Raven...on and on with her raven claws
Raping...on and on with her raven claws

Will she weep for them or whip them once again?

As madmen, some hung head down
From a long dead tree
Some discuss, all at once
For no one to hear

Variations on emptiness
Great themes on vain glory

And as some go feral in strange performances
Dressing customs that are metaphors
Of your disease
Hungry eyes are looking for Me...Mephisto

Laughing, I feed you
With meaningless games, tricks and philosophies
Whose answers you would die for
In your hunger to believe

How it does amuse Me
And makes Me wonder
For how long that it was Mine
Because now it does really inflame Me

As if ignorance was my secret desire...Mephisto

I am an angel who dresses in red
Riding above you, etching fire rings
I have learned to fly
Don't you remember?
While you still have not come down
From your long-dead tree

I can teach you wonders if you give me your soul
Marvels and wild dreams can be yours
I can teach you how iron turns to gold
And how life can grow so old

But I am a demon who dresses in red
And I do not hope you will understand...Mephisto

We are wolf memories
that tear the skin apart
Wolves that once were men
and shall be them again

We are wolf memories
that tear the skin apart
Wolves that once were men
and shall be them again
or perhaps memories of men
who insist of not tearing for to be wolves
but that never shall be them again...

They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light
To blind you and me

Full Moon Madness,
We are as one and congregate
Full Moon Madness
We rise again to procreate

They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light
To blind you and me

Full Moon Madness,
We are as one and congregate
Full Moon Madness
We rise again to procreate to seal our fate

Irreverence was cast out from the sky
And eternity lost its sex forever
And under the same heaven they voted to emptiness
They still celebrate under a Full Moon Madness...

They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light to blind you and me

Irreverence was cast out from the sky
And eternity lost its sex forever
And under the same heaven they voted to emptiness
We still celebrate under a Full Moon Madness...

For that viper that grows inside your head
she remains there waiting to be fed
self made parasite speculating about the end

I ask you

Can you forgive her?

Back into the womb of this holy woman
else pregnant of an entire breed
of men afraid to create, to take place and to proceed

I ask you

Can you forgive them?

They promised me a miracle
a private god for me to hold

Can you forgive me?

They promised me a miracle
someone to really really love

Can you forgive me?

Your handmade god
is back into your womb

Is it right to indulge on an ecstasy
of creating a god that sees what I see,
looks exactly like me, rather what I what I wanted to be

Can you forgive me?

For that viper that grew inside my head
for having betrayed you so well

Can you forgive me?

They promised me a miracle
when all my crimes will be just one
but now is gone.
They promised me a miracle.
Back to your womb it feels so cold.

Crawl me into your second skin
and teach me everything

Second skin

Through your eyes a voyeur
Through your veils of a visionaire
talk to me about those things
no other soul would care.

Second skin

Outcast all the colours that I still have
Camouflage me so I can fall and stand
somewhere between an underrated angel
and all those citizens marked with X-sex.

Second skin

Tissue apart and right to the heart
teach me the wonders of your moral blade
so I can stand still when you have to kill
all that was yours before and now has to fade away

Draw me the fine line between religion and crime
You are one more son of a God you can never be wrong
but aren't we all?

As we sit and wait
for the serpent to bite our very own tale
As I sit and wait
for the serpent to bite my very own tale

Second skin

Men with both roots and wings
they tie us down and ask us to leave
they are teachings unheard, they are bodies on smoke

Men with both roots and wings
at a singular voice we moan
our teachings mislead, our teachings like smoke

we sleep between the storm that was
and the storm which has to come

We've learnt to learn everywhere
and the very own nature has taught us to wait
difference does sound like sin ,equality reliefs
and that fame ryhmes with hate yet everything is fair
on the intervals of your death

misguided demons or forthcoming heroes
each one with an important name
nothing else than an important name.

Men with both roots and wings
at a certain time we are one
our litlle tricks, our innocence stubborn

Men with just little wings, men with just little minds
Men with just little eyes, men with just little deeds

sleeping between the storm that was
and the wind which fails to come [and finally]
blow us away.

Have you ever loved a woman 
who instead of give or trade
would seduce you with a trade 
have you ever loved this man?

Have you ever loved a woman
who should be that little intruder
in the one that you should be

Share the snake with us,
swallow the snake for us...

Have you ever loved a woman
who instead of give or take
would seduce you with a trade

Share the snake with us,
swallow the snake for us...

You have learnt heaven through impure lips
so different from what you have been told
so different from what you have seen

and now that you learnt you will have to release
the tender arms of a woman
which would have strangled you to let you live
you will have to elect choose the fainting arms of this cross
which are just killing you to let you live...

Share the snake with us,
follow the snake with us...

Would you pay by surprise?
Feasting on the dead's cultures?
And Christ what should I say more?
But honestly, I love that

yes, everyone has a price
why is everyone so suprised?
and there is always a claw
at the end of each hand
they stretch down to help you
they stretch down to hurt you

look at me and see your child had you been this good child
and learn from your little girl
as she suicides once more
and then you have failed to be there
too involved in tuning the world's daily lecture
on the vulture culture

God has surprise
I really had - had to watch the ....
But when I'm offered of dead cultures
I can't see anymore
I have to lie

Everything has its price
is everyone satisfied ?
Let me show you my sex
at the palm of each hand
it goes back and protects you
it ends up fucking you

just tune me once more
and just try me once more
just turn me on
just tune me once more

just try me once more
just drive me once more
just turn me on
just tune me once more

sell me out, sell me out, sell me out, sell me...

Yes, everyone has a price
Yes, everything is a prize
Let me show you my surprise,
let me show you my surprise

does it turn you on to keep on tuning on this vulture culture ?

Vulture Culture - are you satisfied ?

Let ME show YOU my surprise...
Let me welcome you to that special place
where EVERYONE is YOURS
Let me welcome you to that special place
and where YOU are EVERYONE'S

Let me welcome you to that special place
where EVERYONE is SANE
Let me welcome you to that special place
where YOU are EVERYONE'S

Let us spare you the GRIEF
that to BE YOURSELF might bring
You are here to be AMUSED maybe confused or misused
to be a living METAPHOR of this MODERN, great swing
Just DRINK and EAT and do not FORGET
to play always SAFE INTERCOURSE

in this human sized and human shaped zoo

WE do not mind to PROGRESS alone
WE do not mind to take it on,
WE do not mind to take CONTROL
WE do not mind to be YOU.

Eurotica

where I wanna be
where I wanna live

Approach and try to live me backwards
then without looking behind
surviving is somewhat confusing
although I never mind

if only silence could ever talk
how loud will be the voice
of this sincerely yours, violently yours

without you I am mute
without you, raped and nude
without you [No] while you are the one can touch me like I do

If only you could crawl by yourself
and release me from all your weight
would I still love you to the point of hate?

Cherish my guilt and then juggle with it
that paper Jesus on your bedroom wall
will bleed us to redeem

Without you I am mute
without you, raped and nude,
Without you while you are the one can hurt me like you do

I want to know how it feels
to proceed without sharing it
your devil disguise is breaking
your face is now so crude
conscious blind and deaf and mute
it is the only way to be just near of you
it is the only way to show myself to you

Without you I am mute
raped and nude, without you...

Tomorrow will you I wake up?
and instead of eyes we will be born with blindfolds
Tomorrow will you I wake up?
and from my mouth will flee a song

Tomorrow I will wake up
with this strange need of not to belong
Tomorrow I will wake up
just to copy whatever is wrong

Tomorrow I will wake up
in a cage of perfect gold
Tomorrow, will I wake up?
hope in tongue, golden song

Tomorrow, I will wake up
with an innate appetite
to be one of yours
to be just one of yours

Tomorrow I will wake up
and try everything not to be alone
Tomorrow will I wake up?
and try everything to be alone

Incise, open wide from the inside
cast out, see what is still left of life live
Secure for me the status of a prime suspect
Tying the hands of a blindman
Teaching the colours to a blindman
and ask him to react, and ask him to react

Tomorrow I will finally feel
a natural natural will
of being artificial

Tomorrow i will feel

into
Decadance
with
elegance.

Hey you little Jesus bride why have you smiled to me?
Hey you little Jesus bride why have you sang to me ?

They say that God is inside us all, and sometimes He is
not in the way that I have preached for to wish to
but God is my lover and I love him too

He acts in mysterious ways
He has such mysterious shapes
I know them all from inside out
and in one by one I do believe - no matter how

and They say the tongue who prays is the tongue which licks
and that the ones who kneel in four shall stand
to be loved by God without having the grace
to see who is behind them now, wearing God's face

the Judgement day is not ever far away
but to how many did it came long before the puberty

Hey you little Jesus bride, why have you smiled to me?
Hey you little Jesus bride, why have you sang to me ?

as they select themselves and cut in innocent flesh
what Jesus really meant by: "Let the children come to me..."

Hey you little Jesus bride, be my wife, be my wife...

Put your arms around my neck
just like a pathetic lace of death
displays like a tarot deck
I am the card of the hanged man

and here I stand
with a flame on my hand
do you understand?

If there is hope for me
she is flirting with the breeze
on a peculiar choreography
with the dead arms of some old southern tree

silently, lips sealed against me
silently, wanna walk with me?

And it makes you wanna know
if in all the stories the truth is really told

And it makes you wanna reborn
and like a snake crawl every warm season
Into a different form

When you can still kill me,
when you can still cure me. Cure me.

Put your lace around my face
just like a fairytale
through the blank of my closed eyes
you can foresee the rope within

And it makes you wanna know
how deep have you truly flown

And it makes you wanna ride
through the fake suicide of someone
already dead inside

Still you walk with me, silently

And it makes you wanna disclaim
something you had really never learnt

And it makes you wanna stay
forever tangled in the pale arms of some hanged man

Here I stand. To understand.
Violently. I have you with me.

So this is
the exemplar deathstyle
you told me about;
you want my seed in
is this the treason
I bare the fame from?
my fatal freedom;
the omniswansong

I carry the news of Darkness and hope

So this is
the underworld
you have in your heart;
you hide in your room
I´m so sorry to say
it only makes me laugh

I carry the news of Darkness and hope

So here I have-your act of love
within the poison-of your every word
each night you stay in-each night I will have to run
knowing from darkness and hope
there is no return.

I carry the news of darkness and hope.

Help me fall from grace
need you to be Incomplete
I am the impostor at your feet
is it your first time
or have you been tempted before
downward into the pulsing life
laying below

try firewalking inside of Me
when everything else falls apart

won´t you fall from grace
I am at a wingbeat
from my retreat
is it your first time or have you been tempted before
downward into the pulsing secret
laying below

try firewalking inside of Me
when everything else falls apart

High heels of crystal
Stuck in the heart
Daylight that heals
The fullmoon scars
Spider strategy
And the wish to be
At one with me
Throughout the fright

It is so real
So full of light
when Nocturna steals the night

Sister of cain
All our breed slain
The youthful oath
Remains the same
Le mal de vivre
That never ends
But the hunt for you goes on
Throughout the light

It is so real
So full of light
when Nocturna steals the night

Never resist
The firewalker
He has been sent
To educate you
never look back
at the great Deep
and never dance to
that curse he sings

Never resist
The life long Pessimist
he is the leader
and not the enemy
My heart complete
put to destroy you
my darkness is obsolete
please let me follow you

And when we meet there
Into the Heartshaped abyss
you´ll scar my your kiss
and when we meet there
into the heartshaped abyss
you'll forgive me everything
scared away
get away

Never resist the firewalker
he has been sent to lay a curse on you
never look back;never resist
Liar I am ready to push you

And when we meet there
Into the Heartshaped abyss
you'll scar my your kiss
and when we meet there
into the heartshaped abyss
you´ll forgive me everything
scared away
get away

Let's get away from this world
to a place we are still beautiful

She wears devilRed

she sweats the poison
all over her
keeps me quiet
inside her storm
she has the method
no other knows

red as the veins,she likes to swim in
floating so gently,through this human misery

She must be a part
Of a Highest Plan
Something I can´t understand

she wears devilRed

She´s selling a damned soul
To whoever pays the most
Her body-the cure
for all evil and good

red as the veins
she likes to swim in
floating so gently
through this human misery

She must be a part
Of the Highest Plan
Something I can´t understand

she wears devilRed

Outside the mythic Rains
let us know we are not insane
blood debts still to be paid
instead we celebrate the Stranger

Inside the mythic Pains are played
blood doubts are asked again
beware the answers you can not tame
might take you too far away

Say what you are
Come here to haunt you
Say what you will
I am going haunt you
And protect you
I am going hurt you

And if we survive this dawn
we wish we'd see the Day
die to comeback a single time
that face in the window
is never the same

Say what you are
Come here to haunt you
Say what you will
I am going haunt you
And protect you
I am going hurt you

Eternal life runs so slow
While you play your lamentation show
Eternal kisses are cold
Why do you think they are beautiful?
Let the candles burn,
And the stakes go through the soul.

Not all vampires suck blood!
Not all of them die for love!

Eternal life runs so very slow,
Impossible, so very wrong.
Final prayers are loud,
How do you think that yours will sound?
Not all romantic wounds,
Most of us are strong.

Not all vampires suck blood!
Not all of them die for love!

Eternal life runs so very slow,
You are the star of my lamentation show.
Eternal kisses are gold,
Yes I think they're beautiful.
Let all candles burn,
None of us are strong.

Not all vampires suck blood!
Not all of them die for love!

I am the flood
who drags the dirt
and lives on it
She is the soil
with whom I flirt
and rots with it
I am the flood
who purifies
I guess she calls Me
the Lord of Lies

when I'm inside her
feels like she is
made of Storm

I am the flood
who likes the dirt
and sleeps with it
she is the soil
with whom I flirt
she rots within
I am the flood
who purifies
She does not know
she's fucking with
the Lord of Lies

when I'm inside her
feels like she is
made of Storm

how we became Fire?
slaves to the smaller Desire
of ignoring wrong and right

when we could have been water
the shape of all things
the end of all things

burning with you
at once the grace
and the curse

how we became Fire?
when we could have been earth
the ground you sleep,rest in

when we could have been air
follow you everywhere

burning with you
at once the grace
and the curse

how we became Fire ?
slaves to the greater Desire
of enlighten you and I
of saving you and I

And when all life as you know it fails
all ghostlike lips taste just the same
What better comfort can you find
Than the serpents in my arms

Sleep, sleep now my child
In the sea of crystal Trouble
For better is the violent sigh
Than all that you leave behind

In your eyes a dark so subtle
Tells you walk, but never fly
To leave us all behind

And when all life as you know it fails
all ghostlike lips taste just the same
What better comfort can you find
Than the serpents in my arms

Down, down terrible child
To look at it is a sin
For better is to hold that smile
Than all that you leave behind

In your eyes a mark so subtle
Tells you walk, but never fly
To leave us all behind

And when all life as you know it fails
all ghostlike lips taste just the same
What better comfort can you find
Than the serpents in my arms

Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head
Mr. Crowley, did you talk with the dead
Your life style to me seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
You waited on Satan's call
Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth
Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear maidens call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall
Was it polemically sent
l wanna know what you meant
I wanna know
I wanna know what you meant

The fury of waters
Revolving still,
Your voices are silences
When they speak through me.
To the crossroads
We are turning our backs
And in each of you wounds
I will plant a seed of belief

In and above Men

The End which is ours
Unclear still,
The thirst growing stronger
And you still won't believe:
Someday we'll come out of our dreams,
And through the eyes you now close
The immense light of the Deep

In and above Men

The fury of Human
Revolting still.
Will we be together?
Finally.
In the crossroad
You gave me your back
And through each of your wounds
You'll bleed the light over me

Bleeding the skies all over me

Diurnal shall be your redemption.
The last of spirits now leaves your body.
We all act as if You are not there.
Seeing is not believing

Possessional, your communication.
What gets inside us the moment we are born?
What was that descending?
From lowering skies

I am no One
The center of Universe
What got inside you?
The moment you were born.
Could you see Him descending,
Descending Supreme
From lowering skies.

From the soul to its waste,
The Common hates his evil twin.
Everything invaded
In its simplicity

How did you get inside me?

Still all fascinated,
Invaded by everything.

In the first morning light
The touch of death covering skies,
Everything invaded
and All the fears inspired

How did you get inside me?

Still all celebrated
Invaded by everything

Everything so full
In the lives I have taken with Me.
All our moments wasted
All is getting in.

Still all violated
Divided by everything

And all the grace disturbed.
All existence false.
All your dead generations!
I am a son of yours and I am coming back.

Everything invaded
In its finality.
Tell me will it hurt
When you get outside of me?

Everything is breaking.
Why have we ever stopped here?
Everything invaded
I am a son of yours
And I am giving up.

Everything invaded
Invaded by everything

The silver bullet - so earthly fast.
Forever Rope - so hard to find.
The silver bullet - so earthly thrashed.
Forever Rope - symbol of Trust.

The mandrake's root, your restless lover.
The Morning blade, first to awake.
The morning shame that you can't take.
The Mandrake's root. In venenum veritas...

The silver bullet. The Southern Deathstyle.
Forever Rope - forever tied.
The mandrake's pill - your magic route to nowhere.
The morning breaks - it's lunar still...

The Elements all moulded together.
A family whose name is Death.
The Elements in circlefear.
Bullet, Root, Blade and Rope
All hold so dear!

Here is to Fear
For keeping us alert.
And here is to Sleep
For making understand.

here's to the crowning roots
placing us nowhere.
here's to the laughable wings
taking us nowhere.

Here's to the Eve
Of the Day which will never come.
And here's to Retreat
To ease the pain.

Here's to Resistance
laughing at ourselves
Here's to Defeat
- how dare you come so late?

The cup is empty
Shall be filled no more
And all the thirsty
Can now approach...

The antidote.

Snowbird, ablaze and hurt.
Brighter, fearless, just like a runaway.
Princess never-a-smile.
Oh, child! What makes you try?
Crying and sobbing
You greet the other day

She who never touches ground.

Spreading an eclipse.
Where never the sun shines,
At her feet.

Frostbite, Astray, Will, Faith.
Haunting, hunting ,she rules the game.
Twin soul you are always a strange.
Nothing ever makes you afraid?
Promising, threatening.
She looks the other way

She who never touches ground.

Spreading an eclipse.
Where never the sun shines
At her feet.

Starlike, but never to be counted.
Look at your hands, child!
Destinies grow back to them.

Daughter sun
With nothing to say.
Never a fullmoon
Just the sickening ray.

Prudent.
In tears hiding,
No water shed.
The sign of the Cross
Will take you to bed.

In Capricorn.

Spreading an eclipse
May never the sun shine
At her feet

The Principles firmly confused.
Shake them awake. The circles vicious.
All full of wishes.

The vapours which invite us in.
In hope we bring the final piece.
Afraid of what it means.

The icy patterns ascending dead.
As I decide to stay.
And cover with shadows my comeback way.

I look outside and it's lunar still.

Now you dream inside
Her sleep of death.
You get to keep your soul
Until she claims it back.

A darkness without end.
Morning was drained.
Here comes the rain.

And on the other side,
All is dark again.
And the dark walls
At your side again.

And you walk
The darkside again.

You are the dream inside
Her sleep of death.
And as I move through her soul
I'll find you hiding in there:

The darkness with no end.
With a light of herself.
No one can forget.

And on the other side
All is dark again
And the dark walls
At your side again.

And you walk
The darkside again.

May you walk the darkside again.

And you walk
The darkside again.

Starts as a feeling pure,
This vitreous second sight
Without hallucinating, hating,
Captive of a future bright

Fortune telling-
Honours for madmen only!
Through the looking glass,
And when the glass looks back.

Why is everything to be denied?
That could make life a little bright.

Horrors guessing, exceptional,
Through details all revived.
Aligned in the death wish prismal
The crystal gazing - silver Eye.

We are the feeble standing
Before the Great Awakening.
The livestock roaming,
Counting the seconds to
Our Second Coming.

Why is everything to be denied?
That could make life a little bright.

Through the looking glass,
And when the glass looks back:
Yourself as a fraud.

The seed of Men,
From trees now freezing.
All silvered leaves
With messages written

The Imitators
In sequences bright.
All perpetrators
In chains of gold.

From the Wait we got our hearts so wet.
The Legend rains our drops of sweat.
Sweet all the Season. The crop is Death.
Reaped on the Rush. You hate yourself.

The best of Men,
Through racks now stumbling.
Learning the blind walk.
All apprentices.

The fieriest Men,
In sheep's clothing,
Have bor exhausted
To everything.

And yes we all believe in Madness.
We are being born at the sound of Ends.
And yes we all believe in cruelty
We breed it out so easily.

It used to be the pride of Men,
Now a flame put out by the cold in his hand.

And yes we all have signed the pacts.
We knew so well nothing was left.
And yes we still believe in Beauty
As we eternally sleep on it.

The last of Men
All hide in here
Domesticated by everything

What's left of the Man
I had within,
Now gone forever
The Beast sets in.

And yes we all believe in Fury.
When nothing else is supposed to be.
Consumed are now all the rewards,
As we eternally...

And we travel into the darkening,
Couldn't smile one final mistake,
The frozen tides keep heading south,
My broken home now far from you,
Surrender slow I move with you,
Whatever nothing you lead me to...
And we travel into the darkening,
Widening the roads behind,
We have reached the southern most,
And we want to know why, we want to know why.
Wish bound, the time has come to choose alone,
To crack the code while you are young, while we feel strong,
Have your revenge with what you saw,
The midnight sun, a life so lived few years and fast.
And we travel into the darkening,
Widening the roads behind,
We have reached the southern most,
And we want to know why, we want to know why.
And we travel into the darkening,
Widening the ones behind,
We have reached the southern most,
And we want to know why, we want to know why.
And we travel into the darkening,
Frightening the ones behind,
We have reached the hearthern most,
And they must to know why
They must to know why.
Darkening,
Lighting,
Frightening,
Weakening...
