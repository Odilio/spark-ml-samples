For sentimental fools

'coz I'm holding on
with a love so strong
and I can't take a day without you by my side

Girl if I could change
If I could change your mind
Baby you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes

Girl don't stop
The sun from shining down on me
'coz I can't face another day without your smile
And if you take away the loving arms that surround me
Then I might break down and cry just like a child

Girl I can't belong and I won't be free
If I fail to bring your loving back to me
So I'm pressing on
I hope you understand
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands

So if I could change
And it won't hurt your pride
Baby you can help me stop these tears from my eyes


Like a child
Just like a child
With the spirits running free
She showed me why
Oh she did

Like a child  oh baby 
Just like a child
Think of what our love could be
If our hearts could set us free
Like a child

Ah, Backstreet
One time here we go yes, yes one time, yes, yes

I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
Caught in a vibe by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There was some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me to you lead me to you

So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost inside your world with you
Oohh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's gotta be
Let's get it on let's get it on
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Play it play it for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?
Make it last now make it last some how

As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotized
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
I was lost inside your world with you with you
Oohh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Close your eyes close your eyes
And imagine us alone Just imagine
Let the music put you in a zone let the music put you in a zone, a zone yeah
I get lost I get lost
Lost inside a groove with you Lost inside a groove
When you do the dance you do
Come on and work your body, work your body

Hey, Mr. DJ
Jam all night long
Hey, Mr. DJ
Play that song for me
Hey, Mr. DJ
Jam all night long
Hey, Mr. DJ

Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada dadadadada
On memory's bliss of you
Dadadadadada Dadadadadada Dadadadadada oh dadadadada

The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
Oh I remember everything
Every smile, and even all
The reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me... Hahahahaha
Baby you set me... Dadadadadada
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you dadadadada
Baby you set me... Hahahahaha Dadadadadada
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you dadadadada

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life ever had in life ohh
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are

Baby will you be there when the morning comes?
Baby will you be there?
Just give me time just give me time
To fix my life to fix my life, baby
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh
I guess that's just the was it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

So come on now Hahahahaha
I know this much is true Dadadadadada
I know this much is true dadadadada Hahahahaha

There are people that say what you wanna hear
Even on a raining day they'll tell you the sky is clear
When you really really love someone
Am I right when I say that you want them near?
And if you can't even tell them things that they wanna hear

Always, forever
All things she said
Never say never
Those simple lies that she fed
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me, no
Cuz that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said, she said, yeah

And there are people that say what they really mean
She said she'd always be there
She said she'd always care
But just when you think that you can
Trust that someone you love
Tell me why, or do you know
How stars can fall from above?

Cuz you made promises
That you couldn't keep
But you're not hurting yourself
You're only hurting me you're only hurting me
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean? you really mean
Oh how can I make you see
Just what you did to me?
Oh, you said how much you really cared
Just when I thought I was in love
Girl, how could you dare?
If I were you I could not lie even once
To the face of the one
That I love so much

If you want it to be good girl
Get yourself a bad boy
Yeah I like this, ha ha

If you want it to be wild
Gotta know just who to dial baby that's me
If you really like it hot
Get someone who hits the spot honey oh yes

And if you want it to get done

The one who's got it goin' on
If you wanna make it last
Gotta know just who to ask

That you'll come back home
And don't take too long

Everything's gone a bit wrong

I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
Cuz all of your time spent keeps us alive

All of your time spent keeps us alive

Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, and that's what makes you larger than life

Yeah

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire
Your one desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me...

You are my fire
The one desire
You are
You are, you are, you are

Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Don't wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
Don't wanna hear you say it
I want it that way
I want it that way

Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love endless love
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you uh huh, uh huh

I can't control it anymore
I've never felt like this before
Mmm, you really make me lose my head
My hungry heart must be fed uh huh, uh huh

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

It's gotta be you uh huh, uh huh
All the way
It's gotta be you uh huh, uh huh
Everyday
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you

Now I know why I was born
You feel my feelings one by one
Can't see the world I'm walking through
Cuz baby I see only you, oh yeah

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop

And you know
I can't see the world I'm walking through
Cuz of you, yeah...
It's gotta be you, all the way
All that I ever wanted
It's gotta be you, I will be true, yeah
It's only you

Open up your heart to me
And say what's on your mind, oh yes
I know that we have been through so much pain
But I still need you in my life this time

And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight

I figured out what to say to you
But sometimes the words they, they come out so wrong, always they do
And I know in time that you will understand
That what we have is so right this time

And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right

All those endless times we tried to make it last forever more
And baby I know

It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you, oh

I need you tonight I need you, oh I need you baby
I need you right now It's gotta be this, it's gotta be this
I know deep within my heart
No, it doesn't matter if it's wrong or it's right
All I know is baby
I really need you tonight

Don't, don't want you back

You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture on the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed babe
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Don't, don't want you back

Don't want you back
Cuz you're no good for me, I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go
I don't want you back

You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize, realize
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I
Don't want you back
That's all I know don't want you back, don't want you back
All I can say
Don't want you back
You know you gotta go

I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, baby
Girl if only I knew what I've done
You know, so why don't you tell me
And I, I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

Don't wanna lose you now
Baby I know we can win this
Don't wanna lose you now
No no, or never again

I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear of losing
Of slipping away
It keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to live that I've had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you

Don't wanna lose to loneliness
Girl I know we can win
Don't wanna lose to emptiness, oh no
Never again

I'll be the one

I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all throught the night

I'll be the one I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light I'll be the light
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright
Cuz my fear is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

To hold you, and make sure that you'll be alright

You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams comin' true
I can show you what true love means
Just take me hand, baby please...

I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright
I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run

I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright
I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright
I'll be the one

To hold you, and make sure that you'll be alright
I'll be the one

It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart

I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
Cuz your love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And made you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only you would tell me girl

Give me one more chance, to give my love to you
Cuz no one on this earth loves you like I do
Tell me...

I turn back time
To make you mine
And find a way back to your heart
I beg and plead
Fall to my knees
To find a way back to your heart

Here we are
In the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong
And love is right
For us tonight
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no one between us
How can they be in my heart
And in my mind
When all I can find
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

When we turn out the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
But girl you know that I would never
Ever let another's touch, come between the two of us

Cuz no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl with just a touch you can do so much
No one else comes close

And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday I'll love you girl in every way
And I always will, cuz in my eyes

It takes a lot to know what is love
It’s not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don’t think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
’cause mom you always were
The perfect fan
God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I’ve had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you’ve done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would
Always be there
I wanna thank you for that time
And I’m proud to say you’re mine

’cause mom you always were,
Mom you always were
Mom you always were,
You know you always were
’cause mom you always were... the perfect fan
I love you mom

Tell me the way we, fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight?
We'll find, the answer to our life

This world is not at ease, we seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do

And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So Please

To help this troubled world start a new

You can’t hide it with a lie
What’s the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong
I heard him promise you forever
But forever’s come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines, oh…

I will love you more than that
I won’t say the words
Then take them back
Don’t give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that

Baby, you deserve much better
What’s the use in holding on
Don’t you see it’s now or never
‘Cause I just can’t be friends
Baby knowing in the end, that..

It’s not too late to change your mind

To the man I wanna be

That we can't forget the struggle

Change can be so good

Even a lover makes a mistake sometimes
Like any other
Fall out and lose his mind
And I'm sorry for the things I did
For your teardrops over words I said
Can you forgive me and open
your heart once again, oh yeah

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

Whatever happened
I know that I was wrong, oh yes
Can you believe me
Maybe your faith is gone
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
Can you forgive me and open
your heart once again, oh yeah

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

I'd do anything to make it up to you
So please understand
And open your heart once again

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

Remember when, we never needed each other
The best of friends like
Sister and Brother
We understood, we'd never be,
Alone

Those days are gone, and I want so much
The night is long and I need your touch
Don't know what to say
I never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do, to make you mine
Falling so hard so fast this time
What did I say, what did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child that, I resemble

I cannot pretend, that we can still be friends
Don't want to be,
Alone tonight

What can I do, to make you mine
Falling so hard so fast this time
What did I say, what did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

Oh I want to say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know, oh yeah

I don't want to live this life
I don't want to say goodbye
With you I wanna spend
The rest of my life

What can I do, to make you mine
Falling so hard so fast this time
What did I say, what did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

What can I do, to make you mine
Falling so hard so fast this time
Everything's changed, we never knew

How did I fall,
in love ,
with you?

Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can’t find no rest
Where I’m going is anybody’s guess

I’ve tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
It’s written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I’ve tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

I don’t mean to drag it on, but I can’t seem to let you go
I don’t wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go alone

I’ve tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

Incomplete

Looking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

Everybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
Baby I was wrong
Yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart
But baby here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

I know you're in there and you can make me wait
But I'm not gonna wait
It's the least that I can do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad, I can't blame you for being mad
But baby here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear my heart that's barely beating
You will see a different man

But baby here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you come on
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in? let me in
I was running from the truth, now I'm crawling back to you

Banging on your front door darling
My pride spilled on the floor
I was running from the truth, now I'm crawling back to you, yeah
Now I'm crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
Crawling back to you
Crawling back to you

Weird world, weird world
Hey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for looking up but I'm feeling down
You see I've got to catch a plane, won't buy a ticket
Cause it's hard to stop when you're spinning around

It's a weird world don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love
It's a weird world, yeah

Sent a message to a GI in the desert
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're having our first baby
He's out there taking them on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

I'm closing my eyes but I'm starting to see
While he's looking at you, she's looking at me
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you
'Cause you're part of this place
But if I die, don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

Hey hey hey
It's a weird world don't you know it?
Hey hey hey
It's a weird world don't you know it?
Hey hey hey
It's a weird world don't you know it?
Hey hey hey

Who are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?
Baby

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last to last

I try to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Ohhhh
Wish I could find you
Just like you found me
Ohhhhh can't live without you

Though everything's been said and done yeah
I still feel you I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you like I'm right beside you
But still no still no word word from you

Yeah yeah yeah

Julie was a long way from home
She could make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of the landscape
Riding her bike through Alphabet City
She likes to party in the backseat
Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow
Taking bets that the sun won't rise

She said, "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"
She can lick her lips and smile
And make you wanna believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now right now
Oooh
Oh ohh

Julie liked to shoplift in stores
Ride alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor 'til the camera made us
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
Where she'd walk I followed followed
When she left I cried

What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?
I was wrapped around her finger
And I began to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la

Oh
Tell me what you want from me
I've got everything you need
It's getting hard for me to breathe
Let me be your guarantee

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

That the consequences poster girl of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world crazy world
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right now right now
Right now ohhh ohh
Poster girl
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Poster girl yeah
Come on come on yeah

Oh no
Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel 'cause I got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

Don't change a thing, perfect as you are
Time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your open arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

Close your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside oh yeah
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss ohh
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way?
If I can't have you
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way
If I can't have you

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now now
Caught by the taste of your kiss I don't wanna know
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this I'm climbing the walls
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss

Ohhhh
I can't let you go no

And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this ohh ohh
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss I miss you

How can I begin to
Tell you what you do to
Me every time I hear ya
More willing to wanna see ya

I know that there's no use in
Tryin' to explain the confusion
But still I'm not complainin'
'Bout my situation

Let's not talk about a
Possible ending

The very first time that I
Was lookin' to be your fella
I found my inspiration
Hidin' in your expression
So I put myself on forward
For your consideration

Let's not talk about a
Possible ending
Let's not think about it
Every day
And I know
I'm so
In love
With you
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath
Every time I'm near
A beautiful woman

And so we put the top down
To take you drivin' downtown
I guess we'll know just what to do
When you're lookin' to fool around

It's too late to stop me
I know we're gonna get down

A beautiful woman
A beautiful woman
A beautiful woman

B is for beautiful
as the sunshine
E tells me everything
is feelin' alright
A goes to you and me
swingin' it down
T is two
I want you
You've got me actin' like a fool

Yeah, yeah
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do"
And after all this time my heart still burns for you
If you don't know by now that you're my only one
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone

I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

Can you see me, here I am
I need you like I needed you then
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart I still find
You're my safest place to hide

You see colors no one else can see
In every breath you hear a symphony
You understand me like nobody can
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming

When this whole world gets too crazy
And there's nowhere left to go
I know you give me sanctuary
You're the only truth I know
You're the road back home

Can you see me, here I am
Standing here where I've always been
And when words are not enough
I climb inside your heart I'd still find
You're my safest place to hide
My safest place to hide

I know I promised you forever
There's no stronger word I can use
To reassure when the storm is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

Oh! Can you see me, here I am
Standing here where I've always been
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart I'd still find
Yeah, yeah
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah
You're my safest place to hide

When you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
And no it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I really miss you
There's something that I gotta say

The things we did, the things we said
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again
You showed me how to face the truth
Everything that's good in me I owe to you

Though the distance that's between us
Now may seem to be too far
It will never seperate us
Deep inside I know you are

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close, everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've gotta say goodbye
I know you will be forever in my life yeah
Never gone

No no no
I walk alone these empty streets
There is not a second you're not here with me
The love you gave, the grace you've shown
Will always give me strength and be my cornerstone

Somehow
Somehow you found a way
To see the best I have in me
As long as time goes on
I swear to you that you will be

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close always close
Everyday everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've gotta say goodbye
I know you will be forever in my life in my life yeah

Never gone from me
If there's one thing I believe I believe
I will see you somewhere down the road again

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are
Always close always close
Everyday everyday
Every step along the way
Even though for now we've gotta say goodbye yeah yeah
I know you will be forever in my life in my life

Never gone, never far
In my heart in my heart is where is where you are you are
Always close, everyday
Every step along the way

Never gone, never far
In my heart is where you are

Hey..

This one is for the mothers…
Who've lost a child
This one is for the gipsys
Who left their hearts behind
This is for the strangers
Sleeping in my heart
Take what they want
And leave while it's still dark

No one is glamourous
Lonely, all by themselves

This is a song for the unloved
This is a music for one last cry
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind
It's a song for the unloved the unloved

This one's for the bridesmaid
Never the bride
This one's for the dreamers
Who locked their faith inside
This is for the widows
Who think there's only one
The dying fathers that never told their sons

No one is glamourous, lonely
Follow your heart…

Ohh
Tomorrow the sun will shine
And dry the tears in your eyes
Suddenly love comes alive…

For one last cry
Just one last cry…

Washed away my sad face,
Flooded all my empty space
You take away life's heartbreak
And I know with you it's gunna be ok

You're rushin through me
Like water from Heaven
I Feel you movin through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Something here
so alive
Cause you're all the air in my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me yeah
over me over me over me

There no more blindness
When I cry I'm smilin
You kept me from dyin
And I know with you I'll keep on livin

You're rushin through me
Like water from Heaven
I Feel you movin through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Something here
so alive
Cause you're all the air in my atmosphere
Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me

It's not enough just holding on
Before I met you I was lost
Now that you're standing here
I don't want you to go
I know that your love keeps me alive

You're rushin through me
Like water from Heaven
I Feel you movin through me
Like sand in the sea
And now I feel so alive
I know that there must be
Something here

Finally I feel complete cause
You are rushed over me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Its 3 am, I can’t sleep
Too late to call this is not like me
But I’m still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back
The able of your chew when you were looking back

See, god you’re beautiful and I’m still coming down
I’d like a one-night stand, but you had to stick around
But I’m still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets
I haven’t changed a thing since you abandoned me

Tonight I stare out the window…
Knowing I’ll never again be alone

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life
Last night you saved my life

Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind
It’s like I knew you all my life even though we just met
My children in your eyes, something you don’t expect

I had to stop myself from calling all day long
I’m glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring
I tried to play it off
But you knew everything

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life saved my life
Last night you saved my life with your love

Last night you saved my life saved my life
Last night you saved my life

Ohh yeah

I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun
Can’t wait to tell you you’re the only one
Last night you saved my life

And I was stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life saved my life
Last night you changed my life
