To the wall-- claims the soldier
My last steps march to the death
Last wills! Hell! This is idiotism
Fuck off to me, fuck off to all of you

To the death-- I raise my head
My last moments--it's my existing
Countdown
A cry for mercy trapped in my throat
But even in hell there's a place for
Cowards

The burning sun over my head
The troop is comin'- compassion I
Dismiss
Sentence of death pounding on my
Back
There's no hiding when you're
Thrown
Against the wall

To paradise, the priest is saying . . .
Blessing my death
He's standing in front of me . . .
His merciful sight sickens me
He says that soon I'll have my
Judgement . . .
I'll kneel down in front of the Lord

And he asks me to regret my sins. . .
But it's too late
Growling words from the bible. . .
Raising my agony
Oh God!. . .
How I'd like to have my hands untied

The wall I'm facing now
Seeing my life going through my
Eyes
Feeling death behind my back
An acrid taste of defeat tormenting
My
Last years
And when I feel my body being. . .
Punched. . . Smashed
There's no pain . . . just silence
My last breath echoing . . . spreading
Through the air
My body in pieces. . . a stream of
Blood . . .

Bloody drops whipping the wall
The silent wall that has understood
My silence
The silence that was a prisoner of
My soul
Is my soul that now is the ruler of
The world

To the wall
The sky throws up storms trying to
Avenge itself
You feel a pain that burns your flesh
Your reflection inside the mirror
Shows a past soiled by the blood of
Innocents
The human greed will be their own
Destruction
The apes in their cages surrounded
By thorns
That are forcing us to live here

I feel an urge to melt and go through
Cracks
To vanish like a fossil that will be
Found
Flying on the universe
Brains of armed lives hidden in pits
It's a fight of dwarves strengthening
The giants
They are sons of the same father,
Fruit of the
Same mother
All of them cry together in despair

But what's heard is only the buzz of
Flies
Over the rotten flesh
There s no more safe ground to be
On
Everybody around you reflects an
Image
Distorted and wounded
I can hear the cry of a million souls
That have been already marked by
Their deaths
While the laughs of satisfaction
Echo endlessly . . .

Insanity-- lacerating the last sanity
Endlessly-- still remains on minds
Lunacy-- masses smashed by a
Holy shit
No regret-- From the past comes the
Storms

The sky throws up storms trying to
Avenge itself
You feel a pain that burns your flesh
Your reflection inside the mirror
Shows a past soiled by the blood of
Innocents
The human greed will be their own
Destruction
The apes in their cages surrounded
By thorns
That are forcing us to live here
I follow the steps I see in front of me
They are deep and well-defined
They show an undefined but straight
path
What has gone through me will never
return
Future won't let me look back
I just walk, I don't evolve, I just walk
Animals run by my side
They try to communicate, Each one in
its own way
But I can't understand
I feel alone on this irrational planet
To create or just observe
I keep walking on this desert made of
ideas
Primitive Future
My head is heavy but empty
Everything around me is void, without
movement
Without perspectives
The night invades the sky
That darkens the dry ground
Making my shadow join the big stain
that's forming
My steps become slow and agonize
I step on skulls of generations that
have not formed
I hear painful cries of wars that are
to come
To create everything again, from the
beginning
To teach new minds
To awake a sleeping giant buried
On the ashes of disgrace
It's scornful the way I live
I look well, I think I'm well
That's all...
I follow the steps I see in front of me
They are deep and well-defined
They show an undefined but straight
path
What has gone through me will never
return
Primitive Future
In the middle of a war that was not
started by me
Deep depression of the nuclear remains
I've never thought of, I've never
thought about
This happening to me
Proliferations of ignorance
Orders that stand to destroy
Battlefields and slaughter
Now they mean my home and work
Who has won?
Who has died?
Beneath the Remains
Cities in ruins
Bodies packed on minefields
Neurotic game of life and death
Now I can feel the end
Premonition about my final hour
A sad image of everything
Everything's so real
Who has won?
Who has died?
Everything happened so quickly.
I felt I was about to leave hell
I'll fight for myself, for you,
But so what?
To feel a deep hate
To feel scared
But beyond that, to wish being at an end
Clotted blood
Mass mutilation
Hope for the future is only utopia
Mortality, Insanity, Fatality
You'll never want to feel what I've felt
Mediocrity, Brutality, and Falsity
It's just a world against me
Cities in ruins
Bodies packed on minefields
Neurotic game of life and death
Now I can feel the end
Premonition about my final hour
A sad image of everything
Everything's so real
Who has won?
Who has died?
Beneath the Remains
The pest in the eyes of death follows
Us
Through the dirty streets of blood
It begins to eat inside us, decaying
Our bones
How will we escape if the void
Covers our lungs
We are buried in the spewed trash
For ourselves

Blood, pain-- nothing to say
Why then-- must we die?

Escape to the void
Escape to the void

I look at my face on the other side of
The mirror
My face falls down in pieces full of
Worms
I burst my rotten heart with my own
Hands
I'm dying and I can't help myself

Blood, pain-- nothing to say
Why then-- must we die

What have I been running from?
I'm not guilty
You've shown me the worst way
Cause you're my victim. . . the next
One

The pest in the eyes of death follows
Us
Through the dirty streets of blood
It begins to eat inside us, decaying
Our bones
How will we escape if the void
Covers our lungs?
We are buried in the spewed trash
For ourselves

Blood, Pain-- nothing to say
Why then-- must we die?

Escape to the void
Escape to the void
Friday, October 2nd, 1992
Chaos has descended in Carandiru, the biggest penitentiary complex in
South America
Over a hundred inmates dead and hundreds injured on the massacre
The police arrived with helicopters and over two hundred armed forces
They took the jailblock called Pavilhao Nove
And opened fire on the inmates in a holocaust method of annihilation
The government of the city of Sao Paulo
Cannot control the brutality of the police

Holocaust
Body piles
Confrontation
Mutilation

Discipline
Ignorance
Conflagration
Torture

Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet
The bodies were filled with bullets and bites from the police dogs
The police try to hide the massacure saying there were only eight deaths

The violence of Brasilian cops is very well known outside of Brasil
This kind of extermination is a method that
They use to get rid of the overpopulation in the jails
The violence of the cops left the whole pavillion destroyed after the
Rebellion

Pavilhao Nove (Pavilhao 9)
At the time of my last pain
I scream, so l can run away
What I see in front of me
Is only the reflection of my insanity

Throwing me to the present
Alone almost in despair
My head throws itself against the
Wall
Making my blood flow free of me
To be born again, it'll be a sad
Destiny
To seek death when it's inside of
Myself
I throw up trying to put it out
I try to sleep sitting on the cold
Ground

Reminders from the past
Repulsion of the present
Fear of the future
Septic Schizo (X3)

Stained by blood on the face
I see that my life goes by in front of
Me
As an old movie. I feel not proud of
Anything
I've done
I scorn myself with anguish

My nerves are blowing
Inside of me my skin burns
I sink my toes on the ground
I wanna quit; but I don't wanna enter
Another place

I'm marked and wounded, the
Decaying of
My thoughts
The rotten smell on my skin
The cold body, thrown and forgotten
I can see things, but I'm blinded to
The world . . .
I am the one Orgasmatron
The oustreched grasping hand
My image is of agony
My servants rape the land
Obsequious and arrogance
Clandestine and pain
Two thousend years of misery
Of torture in my name
Hypocrisy made paramount
Paranoia the law
My name is called religion
Sadistic
Sacred
Whore

I twist the truth
I rule the world
My crown is called deceit
I am the emperor of lies
You grovel at my feet
I rob you and I slaughter you
Your downfall is my gain
And still you play the sycophant
And rebel in your pain
And all my promises are lies
All my love is hate
I am the politician
And I decide your fate

I march before a martiant world
An army for the fight
I speak of great heroic days
Of victory and might
I hold a banner drenched in blood
I urge you to be brave
I lead you to your destiny
I lead you to your grave
Your bones will build my palaces
Your eyes will stud my crown
For I am mars the god of war
And I will cut you down
Walking these dirty streets
With hate in my mind
Feeling the scorn of the world
I won't follow your rules
Blame and lies, Contradictions arise
Blame and lies, Contradictions arise
Nonconformity in my inner self
I won't change my way
It has to be this way
I live my life for myself
Forget your filthy ways
Blame and lies, Contradictions arise
Blame and lies, Contradictions arise
Nobody will change my way
Life betrays, but I keep going
There's no light, but there's hope
Crushing oppression, I win
Betraying and playing dirty, you think
You'll win
But someday you'll fall, and I'll be
waiting
Laughs of an insane man, you'll hear
Personality is my weapon against your
envy
Walking these dirty streets
With hate in my mind
Feeling the scorn of the world
I won't follow your rules
Nonconformity in my inner self
Only I guide my inner self
Fast death, disenchanted by life
Marked by envy and scorn
Show to the world his mortal hate
Die with regret
There's no light and there's no air
The rose's smell corrodes me
A deep agony possesses me
To be forgotten under a burial

Rest in pain
Rest in pain
Rest in pain

You wake up Iying on wet ground
Worms corrode your flesh
Pick up your own eyes
Watch your septic end
To shout at someone and not be
Heard
The silence supports the paranoia
To die crying, this is my fate
The life I choose

Schizophrenia
Paranoia
Insane death
Rest in pain

Fast death, disenchanted by life
Marked by envy and scorn
Show to the world his mortal hate
Die with regret
There's no light and there's no air
The rose's smell corrodes me
A deep agony possesses me
To be forgotten under a burial

Rest in pain
Looking inside, Your future uncertain
The fear grows as a sickness uncured
The silence agonizes, The word sound
strong
Look inside the eyes, Leave this world
Hate through the arteries
Mass Hypnosis
Uncertain of being back
They make you feel so good
Everything's darkened
Obey like a fool
Hate through the arteries
Mass Hypnosis
Soldiers going nowhere
Believers kneeling over their sins
Inhuman instinct of cowardly leaders
Make the world go their own way
Tens of thousands hypnotized
Trying to find a reason why
Look inside your empty eyes
Obey 'till the end
Looking inside, Your future uncertain
The fear grows as a sickness uncured
The silence agonizes, The word sound
strong
Look inside the eyes, Leave this world
Hate through the arteries
Mass Hypnosis
Soldiers going nowhere
Soldiers blinded by their faith
Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

A world full of shit coming down
Tribal voilence everywhere
Life in the age of terrorism
We spit in your other face

War of races
World without intelligence
A place consumed by time
End of it all

We're born With pain
No more We're dead
Embryonic cells

Corrision inside -- we feel
Condemned future -- we see
Emptiness calls -- we hear
Final premonition -- the truth

Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

We're born With pain
Suffer Remains
We're born With pain
Suffer Remains
We're dead
Born with remorse
To a cold barren place
Battle between minds
Hungry for words of prey

Contradictory truth
Secrets in lies
Meaningless movements

Icons reviews their sins
Faith cheaper than thou
Doubting your ideals
Torment shreds your brain

Fearful fantasy respects the unknown
Turning your heart red
A requiem to celebrate ... you

Words I can not understand
Shrieks in my moment of pain
Imposter hides behind a mask
My words against your lies

Turn my head
To see what I know
A shadow without form
Painted on the wall

Born with remorse
To a cold barren place
Battle between minds
Hungry for words of prey

One moment's mistake
False steps in the ground
Laws made by the blind
Ruling reign of light

Contradictory truth
Secrets in lies
Meaningless movements
I've seen you fighting through the time
I've followed your steps full of pain
Unnamed hero that's challenged the
human ego
Victim of cowardice
Of strong manipulation
A system that was made to lie an to
deceive
Screams of agony
Satisfy the proud
But these screams still echo in side the
conscience
Contradiction, Aggression, Desolation,
Illusion
Nonconformity takes my mind
Too much injustice to forget so fast
My disgust is greater than my
compassion
Feel the pain upon my final hour
Self-blame can't hurt me
Eye for an eye
You receive your just reward
Now I'll live my life with indifference
I've tortured without remorse
I've slaughtered without fear
Brain Killing Brain
Brain Killing Brain
Brain Killing Brain
Brain Killing Brain
Rio Summit, '92
Street people kidnapped
Hid from view
To save the earth
Our rulers met
Some had other
Secret plans

No...no...no...no...

Say what?

Strip-mine the Amazon
Of cells of life itself
Gold rush for genes is on
Natives get nothing

Biotech

Is Godzilla

Mutations cooked in labs
Money-mad experiments
New food + medicine?
New germs + accidents!
Like Cubatao
World's most polluted town
Air-melts your face
Deformed children all around

Bio-technology
Ain't what's so bad
Like all technology
It's in the wrong hands

Cut-throat corporations
Don't give a damn
When lots of people die
&gt;From what they've made

Is A.I.D.S.?

Stop!!!
The dual substance of Christ
The yearning so human
Of Man to attain God
Has always been a deep
Inscrutable mystery to me
My principle anguish and source
Of all my joys and sorrows

Religious domain is all I see
Suffocate the scum with mediocrity
Lying and changing your fate

From my youth onward
Has been the incessant
Merciless battle between
The spirit and the flesh
And my soul is the arena
Where these two armies
Have clashed and met

Holy wars unleashing bloody raids
The sacred earth without a face
Consumed by murderous sinners
Psychotic leader

Living in a dying age
Persecute the human race
Triumph of death in the wasteland
Blood signs your epitaph

Religious domain is all I see
Suffocate the scum with mediocrity
Lying and changing your fate
Death comes from the unknown
Darkened by its own existence
The end no longer exists when the
Spirit
Leaves the body
Phenomenon that mankind would
Rather forget

Shadows and cries
Are found together trapped inside a
World
Hateful was your life in the past
To torment someone is your present
Destiny

I feel pleasure seeing your agony
It burst my insane subconscious
&gt;From life I took nothin' but insults
&gt;From death I got irrational pleasure

Is it possible to feel satisfied after
Death
Yeah, life has marked you with
Despair and takedown
Death welcomes you as a seed lost
In oblivion
As a bastard son the world has
Rejected

Life betrays you on each step
On each body that faces you

On each soul that meets you
On each tomb that is closed
Screaming
For more justice
Amazonia burns
Can you hear them ?

I'll fight
To save another day
So join us
And we'll make them leave this land

ThreateningTo kill how we feel
(but) if we stop them it'll be worth dying for

When you go down !!!
When you go down motherfucker !
When you go down !!
When you go down fighting !!

When you go down !!!
When you go down motherfucker !
When you go down !!
When you go down fighting !!
Motherfucker !

When you go down !!!
When you go down motherfucker !
When you go down !!!
When you go down fighting !!

When you go down !!!
When you go down motherfucker !
When you go down !!!
When you go down fighting !!

Why ? Why ? WHY ? WHY? WHY ?
WHY ? WHY ? WHY ?
The mist is high in this night
Can felll the presence of Death
Way to the mortuary so the dead's will invoke
Corpses and skulls in my countour
See a corpse bloody with the face in cruciform
How being from the wrath
Catch the skull of a children, frozen and dismal
Coming to me
Creature , kill in name of hell
The black mass is started, life's will terminate
With the wrath of demons started the genocide
Wrath, in my corpus is born
Death, lost legions from hell
Slaughter, you'll see in sacrifice
Skull's are Christen's with blood

Necromancer
Dead's invoker
Necromancer
Dead's invoker

Wrath, odius desire
In my corpus is born
The fates last, terror's spread
For a necros creature of
The crypts'

I shall redeem myself from
The clutches that grasp at my inner self
No tomorrow will ease my oppression
My streak of hate leads my way
Look at me
My feelings turn
Stronger than hate
I can't decide on which way to turn
My choices are few and far between
Look at me
My feelings turn
Stronger than hate
I can't decide on which way to turn
My choices are few and far between
A lifetime of remorse
There's no place that I've ever been
I stand above their remains
My vengeance I have regained
I don't know what lies on the floor
I won't be locked up anymore
Standing here I've lost all faith
I have no social equality
To live again would be a lie
My life is not worth the pain
Telling lies right into your face
Grab your soul and make a disgrace
Make you believe you're bigger than life
No one cares if you'll live or die

Waiting for the moment to strike
To take possession to take your heart
Turn your part into a farse
Without respect, without regret

Cut-Thoat - cut-throat
Cut-Throat
Cut-Thoat - cut-throat
Cut-Throat

You promess this and promis all
Deep inside nothin at all
In a war of filth and greed
We don't need none of this shit

All I say that will survive
We know what's true, we know what's right
We're going through this till the end
And I know you're not my friend

Cut-Thoat - cut-throat
Cut-Throat
Cut-Thoat - cut-throat
Forgive me father
Forgive me God
I know I've sinned
With no remorse
Apocalyptic visions
Went through my head
Here today
Gone tomorrow
It's all insane
I'm feeling sick
I'm feeling numb
The storm will come
In the name of God
I'm the chosen one

Terror raids the land
To ashes we'll be sent
In the name of God
Lives cast away

Martyrdom of myself
Armageddon comes
In the name of God
Not one more dead

Fire blasting, cutting edge
Children burn in flames
In the name of God
We're going insane

Let us die
You don't realize
This is the time
God's sacrifice

Leaving behind
Lesson in hate
In the name of God
We're all dead

Burn!
Humidity could be felt on the walls
Touched with the palm and used to
scare
They used to sweat, They used to stink
Everything swamped and hot
But in the corner, Laying on a bed
A cold piece, Made to stay alive
Trapped within its body
It could not think anymore
Thoughts of times of sanity
The world was isolated
Where the sun would salute him
And the night was violent
Fear and Guilt
Invade the corners of the room
Pain was felt constantly
They keep on destroying
It could be seen through the window
The eye of disgust and scorn
When you hear the laugh of a madman
That's about to die
To suffer alone in disgrace
His hate is his own
Always hating being alive
Sarcastic Existence
I ask myself why I'm so hateful
Perhaps it's just part of my nature
People say I'm fucked it in my mind
Feels like there's nothing left inside

Walking now on different dirty street
But the same old feeling still exists
Hate is like a shade that won't never leave
Leave me alone I don't need sympathy

What goes around
Comes around
You going down
Down

Straighthate - Straighthate
Straighthate - Straighthate

Criticize and call me negative
But you never deal with life or reality
I separate myself from the rest
What da fuck you expect ?

What goes around
Comes around
You're fucked up
You going down
You're fucked up
You going down
Down
Rotting skinny corpses left alone
They're like and endless disease
Invisible, Painful, Eternal
Creatures fucked by a greedy past
Since you were born
You want to make money and power
A simple fuel to the corrupt
Way of mankind
Hungry for living, To live like a slave
Without knowing your master
You have no value, Your just another one
Death will quench your hunger
Hunger for confidence
To shake the hand of your best friend
And later to be betrayed
The law rules the mind of ignorance
Hungry for pleasure
You act like a robot
The tears in your eyes
As red as blood
Your pleasure is pain
Your pleasure is torture
Hunger is your pleasure
Hungry for the future
Life !!
The struggle to survive
Crawling, ragin
Feed the hate inside

Are we going to see another day ?
Are we going to make it all the way ?
Are we going to see the light of day ?
Are we going to make it till the end ?

Rise !!
Bad moon rise
Another war, another crime
End in sight

Bleak !!
Why & what the fuck ?!?
Shut your mouth, shut your mind, this the way
You're just another prey

Is that what we've became ??

RISE !

Are we going to see another day ?
Are we going to make it all the way ?
Are we going to see the light of day ?
Are we going to make it till the end ?

Endangered Species ( 3 x )
Is that what we've became ??
Travelling through the time
Moving slowly in the sand
Knowledge is the weapon
Against the hunger in the land

Solitude met herself
Lessons from the primal step
Memories from an ending life
Liars can't stop the tribes

Nomad
Nomad
Nomad
Nomad

Brother is the son of rape
The blood that once unites
Wanna choose the way they die
Look inside their minds

(Echoes in the)
Actual tribe no longer sounds
The ancient teachings failed
Movement of my culture
My beliefs have no more tales

Who are you to criticize
To judge and burn the tribes
The world will be extinct
And your flesh will rot with mine

Total Eclipse Hides The Earth
The Night Of Doom Has Come
Antichrist Soldiers Are Proclaimed

The Messiah, Redeemers Of Mankind
Chained In The Valley Of Hades
Crowds Blinded By Evil

The Nuclear War Announces The End Of The World

They Foresee The Triumph Of Your Death
Why don't you get a life and grow up
Why don't you realize that you're fucked up
Why criticize what you don't understand
Why change my words, you're so afraid

You think you have the right to put me down
Propaganda hides your scum
Face to face you don't have a word to say
You got in my way, now you'll have to pay

Don't, don't believe what you see
Don't, don't believe what you read
No!!!

I know my ways, I'm here to stay
I didn't star all this yesterday
I'll prove you wrong all the way
Life teaches me you're always alone

All of us are victims
Confined by enigmas
Without solution
Your frozen thoughts don't let you
evolve
A prisoner of your own trap
Slaves of an infinite pain
What will be the limit?
What will be the end?
Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain
Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain
Seeking new paths
Don't be tied to your mistakes
Run away from this
Uncured sickness
Open your eyes
Don't lose your steps
Liberty is a dream
And it is also real
To die to run away
To forget what I've been
To erase my past
To kill my guilt
Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain
Pain makes me stronger
Everyday
Life in chaos
You gotta deal with it

Expressing my aggressions
Through confusion
Face reality
Nothing is like it used to be

Don't tell me I don't know
You don't live in my war
Revolt and anger
I won't take it anymore

Don't get me wrong
You don't know where I'm from
Don't get me wrong
You don't know where I've been
Don't get me wrong
It's been a painful way
Don't get me wrong
You wouldn't understand

Chaotic violence in my eyes
This whole world moves backwards
Peace, another sign that lies
Life today is not worth the pain

On the radio, another homicide
Inmates suffocate in jail
Severed heads of revolt
I wish I'd never been born

Same hand that builds -- destroys
Same hand that relieves -- betrays
Same hand that seeds -- burns
Same peace that exists -- here lies

I can't trust anymore
Criminals within the law
I have something to say
Where I live, don't believe in another day

Heresy and graft
Apartheid
Same religion that saves -- damns you!
Fear in my subconscious
Terror invades my speech
Faith in my own words
No one knows the nameless

Warm winds and burning tears
Spirits outside bodies

Endless repression by majority
A master without command
Strange new dimension disturbing my brain
Censored ideas, counterfeit answers

Shining blast, no preception
Alstered state, no reaction
Shining blast
Altered state

Slow talk, fast thoughts
Ancient sciptures
Controversial lines
Knowlegde changes

Running in the wrong direction
Crossing with blind eyes
I'm closer to myself
Sanity can't invade
First generation born
A plague was created
The cure is in my mind
Solitude is all I see

Powerful nations repress feeling
Buried beneath the fear
Making you a coward
Buying your safety

Grey shadows fill your head
Stealing your last breath
Scared of the future
Prophecies of chaos

Subtraction of personality
Within the human race
You'll always be

Green castles from the past
Bleeding in sands of war
No man is immortal
History is no more

Confused leaders behind our backs
Stifling our ideas
Misunderstand signs of progress
Minds of time regress
Sacrifice is pleasure
When life ends in pain
Conceive the last mistake
Which belongs to all

Creation of insane rule
All we hear:
Desperate cry

Death the coldest wind
Seeps into your pores
A nation born of hate
Forgotten distant time

Creation of insane rule
All we hear:
Desperate cry

Endless empty maze
Despair, distress and silence
A poison vacuum, infinity
Life, lies, deceit

Mute souls end in silence
Oceans tainted with blood
Empty promises of hope
Buried deep, infected ground

Creation of insane rule
All we hear:
Desperate cry

Cry!
Fear ties you up
And you don't grow
Being wrong and lost
No one admits the defeat

Conscience is fair
Unfaithful words
Betrayal and greed
Past thoughts to win alone

Envy -- still strong
Hatred -- still alive
From beyond -- an empty world
Infected voice -- a scream alone

Infected voice!

My throat is dry
A last cry tries to escape
Guilt and frustration
No time to turn around

Looking behind I'm not alone
Are they friends or enemies?
Going insane without a cure
Scarring my eyes, visions lost
Obscured by the sun
Apocalyptic clash
Cities fall in ruin
Why must we die?

Obliteration of mankind
Under a pale grey sky
We shall arise...

I did nothing, saw nothing
Terrorist confrontation
Waiting for the end
Wartime conspiracy

I see the world -- old
I see the world -- dead

Victims of war, seeking some salvation
Last wish, fatality
I've no land, I'm from nowhere
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Face the enemy
Manic thoughts
Religious intervention
Problems remain
Unknown man
Speaks to the world
Sucking your trust
A trap in every world

War for territory
War for territory

Choice control
Behind propaganda
Poor information
To manage your anger


Dictators' speech
Blasting off your life
Rule to kill the urge
Dumb assholes' speech

Years of fighting
Teaching my son
To believe in that man
Racist human being
Racist ground will live
Shame and regret
Of the pride
You've once possessed

Chaos A.D.
Tanks on the streets
Confronting police
Bleeding the plebs
Raging crowd
Burning cars
Bloodshed stars
Who'll be alive?!

Chaos A.D.
Army in siege
Total alarm
I'm sick of this
Inside the state
War is created
No man's land
What's this shit?!

Refuse/resist
Refuse

Chaos A.D.
Disorder unleashed
Starting to burn
Starting to lynch
Silence means death
Stand on your feet
Inner fear
Your worst enemy

Refuse/resist
Refuse/resist
Creepy crawl
On concrete and dust
Asphalt jungle
Piles of crust

Non sense thoughts
Inside the mind
What really means
What I want ?

Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way

Straight old thoughts
To force you down
Raping rape
Breed apart

Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
Roots Bloody Roots
Roots Bloody Roots
Roots Bloody Roots

In Our Fate

Where We Shall Find Our

Roots Bloody Roots

Rain
Bring Me The Strength
Is Breeding Me This Way
Born from hell
The supreme force of evil
To destroy the altar
And slaughter the Christian's born

Churchs will be destroy
Crosses will be breackn
He's laughing in blasphemy
Like a domain of death

Antichrist

The war is started
Heavens on fire
From deep of hell
Leaving words of hate

Antichrist

The terror is declared
The final fight started
The Antichrist and Lucifer
Fighting with angels and God

Antichrist
A legion of demon's
Born from the boundaries of death
Like a onslaught of evil
To destroy this Earth

Covering the morbid skys
Like a mist of sulphur
I can see Satanas
The cursed of death
Terminate masse's and reigns
With blood axe's of hate
The beasts of son of evil
Tormenting the preacher of Christ

The human's try to react
To this nuclear war
Wich is like a endless pain
Burning in the fire of hell.
Face-the enemy
Stare-inside you
Control-your thoughts
Destroy-destroy 'em all

You censor what we breathe
Prejudice with no beliefe
Senseless violence all around
Who is it that keeps us down

Once all free tribes
Chained down led lives
Blood boils inside me
We're not slaves, we're free

Face-the enemy
Stare-inside you
Control-your thoughts
Destroy-destroy 'em all
Hate them hate them
Live your farce
Same thing, same way
Your karma will come

Ask me no questions
I tell no lies
Ask me again
I spit in your eyes

Live your life
Leave me alone !!!
Live your life
Leave me alone !!!

Face me, face me
Feel the cut
Open sore
Always bleeding

Live your life
Leave me alone !!!
Live your life
Leave me alone !!!

Spit !!
Spit !!
Spit !!
Spit !!
Marching over the mist
Leaving behind the wheack's
Going this endless war
Like a tormenting nightmare

Over the devastate ruins
I raised a sign
The sign of hate
For a masses despair

To revenged the years
Arrested in abyss
Where Jesus Christ
Made his suffer

But the final command
Is happening here now
Which I see is the ruins
And warriors marching to death.
One week of struggling
On the real world is..
So you can see !!!

Feel your soul and...
Shape your mind to warfare
It's all for real

Live your life
Not the way they taught you
Do what you feel !

Survive the jungle
Give me blood
Give me Pain
These scars won't heal

What were you thinking
1964
Coup d'etat
Military force
Hundreds dead

Why did they disappear ?
Dictatorshit
Why did they disappear ?
Dictatorshit
...

1995
Spirit still alive
We still hear the cry
From the one that survived !!

Why did they disappear ?
Dictatorshit
Why did they disappear ?
Dictatorshit
We who are not as others
We who are not as others
We who are not as others
We who are not as others

We who are not as others
We who are not as others
We who are not as others
We who are not as others
The curse in launched, beware
The Lord of Death declared the war
Satanas is invoked to destroy,
And to command the bestial
Devastation.
