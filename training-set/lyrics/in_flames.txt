Tired of dull ages, I walk the same ground,
Collecting the tragedies still
Hollow ambitions in a hollow mind
Carried my cross to the hill

And how I lust for the dance and the fire
Deep of the nectarine sunset to drink
Spill me the wind and its fire
To steal of the colors - I'm the moonshield

Shattered hope became my guide
And grief and pain my friends
A brother pact in a blood-ink penned
Declare my silent end

Naked an dying under worlds of silent stone
Reaching for the moonshield that once upon us shone

And how I lust for the dance and the fire
deep of the nectarine sunset to drink
spill me the wind and its fire
to steal of the colors

I'm the... I'm the... I'm the...
I'm the moonshield

Stood there leaning to the city moon,
casting silhouettes tall to grip her white rooms
the black-clad voyeur in his black-clad masque
in the serpentine sun of tragedy basked

Stood there cursing at the soul-dead mass
with their fabled illusions, the vain dreams that passed
splinters of a life rushing by in the whirl
alone, silent warrior in a fantasy world

He cried for night / but night could not come
so, swept in the shroud of misanthropia he went away
and fed the empty galleries
with the artifacts of the black rain
sunken into the shadows with a dry, sardonic smile

He made the footprints a part of his heart
to rouse a sacred confrontation

Stood there carving on the monument to lies
digging of the Earth, making friends with the soil
as the all-mother rises and bares her bleeding thighs
he disappears into her cold, icy womb

Mankind - proud conqueror and king
swings its flag of primal glory to the winds
Titans of the power-myth that failed
Neanderthal hunger for the flesh of war so frail

So weak, so hollow-minded
the primat flock responds
the jester race submits

For each day of war is a failure for man,
enslaved in her mordial genes
Illusions bleed from their fetid cores,
bent to their rotten extremes

We, the plague of Terra Firma,
nature's grand and last mistake
plant the poisoned seed of cancer,
set the severed fruits awake
Burning like frozen relics
in god's archaic graveland

Burn the visionaire
Kill the ideaologies
Mankind must die

The doves and the angels return to their graves
with flames on their pestilent wings
while mushroom-clouds haunt their virginwhite skies
to rape their utopian dreams

Living the last days of evolution's end
from the nest of humanity, the graveland vultures rend

I lie in your soothing arms, lord Hypnos
your garmet alive with your song
I lie in your soothing arms, lord Hypnos

Steep the spiral to your far abode,
in the wake of slumber, on visions I rode
and fell like history through the chasm of ages
into the charged, forbidden zones

How I have searched
through a million worlds and faces
yet unaware, I have not found
my own true face, traceless and profound

So, find me in these grandiose halls
where long ago summers eternally fall
and tune the strings of truthful longing
to the frozen music of gods

Hypnagonia's lucid horizons
play with the yearning I've quelled
as I strike towrads the Pantheon
and what therein is held

I bid you welcome to my world
They call me existence
You have just entered through the gate
to your journey towards eternity
This part I control
In the beginning you'll fear nothing
As I climb beside you
Time will be your master in this laborious part of
human subsistence
This part I control
Black clouds embraces your soul
Slowly passing through repeating lacunas of anguish
When time takes your life
I wil transfer you into the bare grip of thinking tranquillity
Voices frilling the emptiness of the dead floating
Seamless across the surface into chilling stillness
Nothing can help you now

You'll never be along again
You'll never die again
You'll never be born again
You'll forever be, stuck here in eternity

Rush faster on the one-way lane
the answers so silent

Rusty gods in their machine-minds armours
grind our souls in the millstone of time
the "deathbed harvest" is dead man's banquet
of mould ridden bread and black, poisoned wine

And we go..our steps so silent
And we go..our blooded trace;
The Jester Race

Calling our to the gathered masses;
their answers so silent

And we go..

Embracing the tools of the neo-wolf age
that speak of silence and silence alone

Offering the tokens, the reliced idols
to the heirs of the newly raped ground
inferior even to the transparent winds
lesser in motion and sound

And we go..

There is no trace of me
in their altered blueprints of life

Gaia impaled on their horns and lances
to fumes from her body give case
as the throng of blind mind savour the scent,
dream-dead from prosaic and hate

Sunwind strokes the electroheart,
ignition roars through the corridors,
stream launching the binary vessels

Vanities in extreme formations
ride into tomorrow's rigid great face
The Machinery outlives the futile scripts
of our dying jester race

Towards the rich archaic heavens; towards the lack diorama
you are the artist and the texture
that plays with the mantle of the Earth

When the bleakest of powders
lie rooted to the starched stones
and roots that feed the peaking trees
embrace the sleeping shores

Archaic pearls of sleep and death
the voice of December losing its breath
and the floweryard of whit and grey is haunted

White as the down of flaking snow,
the heroic emblems of life

Green is the color of my death
as the winter-guise I swoop towards teh ground
Green is the landscape of my sorrowfilled passing

We are In Flames,
towards the dead archaic heavens
We are the mantle and the texture
the alters the mantle of the Earth

To slit the grinning wounds
from childhood's seven moons
the palette stained with the ejaculated passions
(of forbidden, hedonistic colors...)

Strike from omnipotence; all-seer, all-deemer
and haunt my severed country with your
dripping, secret games

You pick the unripe lilies
deflored and peeled the bleeding petals
made known to me
the grainy stains, the crimson lotus
of the Black-Ash Inheritance,
the semen feed of gods and masters
The worms still in me,
still a part of me,
racing out from leaking rooms,
swoop from broken lungs to block the transmission
to put an end to the nomad years

Father
you are the
dead god in me

Do you feel anything at all?
Do you hear steps at the door?
Do you reckon the smell of....?
It's life-the the dark that binds you

Frightened by your own smell
Bitterness will run you through

Silent screaming
Turning, twisting the alphabet
Frantic eyes
Awaiting the answer
Splinters of a poem
Fragments of what you used to be
Habitual and gullible
Run-down memoirs is all that's left

Do you wish to sleep?
Do you aim for the shadow?
Do you feel infected?
It's life-the the dark that binds you

It's the cowardice that pulls you under
And takes you to the end, where it begins
Release, the world is waiting on your arrival
Close your eyes, as we witness another bullet ride

Do you know about atrocity?
Do you that everybody's gone?
Do you know that you're on your own?
It's life-the the dark that binds you

As I aim for that bright white day
Conflict serum is my aura
It seems that life's so fragile
I guess I'll fly some other time

I lack from superhighway thoughts
Won't live as long as the city lights
Soaked by underwater times
Electric splash on a midnight drive

Wish I could rape the day,
just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver, still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride

Sometimes I don't belong
Release me from your world
Pacified by the small things in life
I wait for earthquakes to rearrange

Never been able to use the force
I only have it read to me
Despite all the misguided faith
(Maybe) I'll find a place in this mess

Early morning moments
A glimpse of joy
But soon it's over and I return to dust
As I try to be
Everything and everyone
I shrivel up and waste away

I can't tolerate your sadness
Cause it's me you are drowning
I won't allow any happiness
Cause everytime you laugh, I feel so guilty, I feel so guilty

Am I forced to have any regret
I've become the lie, Beautiful and free
In my righteous own mind
I adore and preach the insanity you gave to me

Sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
No need for sympathy, the misery that is me

I've lost the ability to paint the clouds
Cause it's me you're draining
I'm stuck in this slow-motion dark day
Cause everytime you run, I fall.. Behind, I fall behind

And so I hear my voice again
The tale of the bitter man here I am
Shake the silence and hear what it says
The tranquil pride that become the lie

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak
No need for sympathy, the misery that is me

Sell me to infection, it is only for the weak
On bleeding knees, I accept my fate

For so long I tried to be like you,
Pushed aside with no time to evolve..

There's no place that still remains
Just deserted space all left in grey
Why did we lose, the knowledge of time?
Is this the price, the hell we pay?
The poisoned fear known to man
is he who try to find his path
The collective force blaming you
"This is day day we split in half"

Thrown to the gallow, forgotten and sore
sworn to be different in what way I can
The sultry taste that is special to me
is the last gleeful glimpse of a bitter man

Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
as the future repeats today

So impressed, lost the faith in all I had
Broken down, I'm on my way to be dissolved

The hopes and prays of things to come
I've lost them all with glory
Urgent to aim for that short-lived joy
I see gold in all that lies before me

And so we ignore the baggers cup
Praise your act in the Grand Finale
Teach the unborn the winners sign
a welcome grin to the world Royal

Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
as the future repeats today

Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
as the future repeats today

For all the times you left me bleeding
Clouded, weakened by the haze
Cut of my pride, enough to forgive
Reconcile, back to square nothing

It seems I lost my direction
Don't have the strength to let it slip
Have no desire for the shore
Just let me play here for some time

Spend some quality time with the demon of mine
I like the way you struggle but you know I'm here to win

Is this how I want to spend my days?
Shadowed, it fears me, my utopia
Try to find some peace to destroy
These are my sins, I'm heading to fall
Never understood though I accepted
All the weakness that I discover
You gave me a place to hide and lost the key
Drowned my head just to see it sink (to the bottom)

Spend some quality time with the demon of mine
He said "I like the way you struggle but you know I'm here to win"
Spent some quality time with my borrowed smile
The gleam is replaced, rip me open and erase me

Spent some quality time with the demon of mine
I like the way you struggle but you know I'm here to win"
Spent some quality time with my borrowed smile
The gleam is replaced, rip me open and erase me

Your self control makes me feel alone
I've tried confidence, had it for breakfast today
I've lost the perfection, a mess without words
(And) As the seasons change I'll continue to ignore
The image I project - me without me
The picture that I scanned is borrowed

After the education you stopped making sense to me
Seems to me that it's all the same, time and time again
Slowly, all that I believed in, turning into a lie
To aim and miss, my supernatural art
Spending to much time with myself
Trying to explaining who I am

How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
(Suddenly) I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay

I need someone to break the silence
before it all falls apart
I need something to cling onto
before I break you in parts

So afraid of what you may think
And all the plastic people that surrounds me
I have to find the path to where it all begins
To teach the world my supernatural art

Since the day of my departure
I've been stumbling through reality
I play my symphony in reverse
In search for that special path

Be gentle to the tear in this I
Lonesome arms, lost its wings again

Buy me a trip to the moon
So I can laugh at my mistakes
I can see the end from here
From this perspective it looks kind of silly
Satellites and astronauts
Tell me there are greater things ahead

Make me feel like a man
A silent cry from the middle of hell
I - the irony - I promise, I'll be mature
So please, invite me to your shelter again

Been hiding since I heard "never"
Take me back to yesterday, I need to grow

Steal my mask and make me pay
I need a new skin
I'm going insane

In the most desolate corner
A bad case of the urban blues
Another brick in the living shadow
All inhale the downward spiral

Hey, get in line for tragic
Let us dance to the pistol magic
Just aim and end another
But think, as I rape your mother

Another player joins the table
Who I can or cannot trust
When do we get assigned?
Pure and precious with bad intentions

Hey, come and join the show
All the cameras are ready to go
Just aim and end another
But think, as I rape your mother

A single step - a garbled life
Where's the profit?
Your rage - the pain
Will it all be worth it?

Genetic, it seems to be....
Abandon, the mass ideal
Lets re-unite and brush the dust away
We think we're in control then we become the things we hate
Lets re-unite and brush the dust away

Obtain a prosperous future
and the admiration of all
Act in "the sensations" media hour
All inhale the downward spiral

As we build a brand new planet
Let's reconstruct and get it straight

Unlock forgotten skills
Travel to a new dimension
Solace from the dark seduction
(Take heed) we are the new invention

We're the settlers of year zero
Let's reconstruct and take it back

Leaders of our time
Heading for a downfall
The threshold of revolution
(Take heed) the last freedom call

Blanked out fire etched on the crystal display
The sees are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb
Collect the word, add some gold and give it back
The sees are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb

From a thousand branches
Spreading the new voice

As we're heading for the throne
Connect, evolution will begin

The self-inflicted state of mind
A one-man struggle beneath the tower
I think the clock still exist
god just forgot to tap my shoulder

I woke up today
I wish I felt something
The odour of my apathy
just might be true

I want to be the things I see
The pilgrim that is me
But I know I ain't that free
The suburban me

Spirits rise and miss the eye
Covered by the stench of judgment
As gods reflection test my pride
I serve the failure that's haunting me

Twisted visions torturing
Who claims to be the one?
That filtered smile
just might be true

"On half-speed, tonight I suffer
Satisfaction brings the unheeded"

Can you hear the message,
as I wrestle with the clouds?
I'm on the way to succumb,
It just might be true

The other side of the platinum door
another day in quicksand
Still feel close to nowhere
I hope this is the right way

How come you see me as an enemy?
We just think in different words

I see beauty in dead flowers
I let the tide show me what's next
But all you do is fade away

There's no shame in being the fool
I've been to places you'll never find
The empty plate that you call home
Won't bring glimmer to future years

By myself, staring into space
You're just bored of the silence it makes

They come from a land were the sun don't shine
running away from the cold
They travel so far in the name of love
hoping the dreams will come true

Walking the way through endless fields
trying to make it together
Troubled within ever sinking kiss
Just like the full to fall in love
And they will give anything
just to be free from the pain
and they won't surrender

Living in a world of promises
Living in a world of dreams and hopes
Living in a world of promises

Lost in the city wondering why
no one will open the door
It's more to the truth than meets the eye
something they all felt before
And they will give anything
just to stand tall once again
and they won't surrender

Living in a world of promises
Living in a world of dreams and hopes
Living in a world of promises

In the tan of the nigh can hear them crying
out for a life to hol on to
Somebody knows were the answers lying
wait for your trails and don't let go

Living in a world of promises
Living in a world of dreams and hopes
Living in a world of promises

One lie was all it took everything ended right there
You didn't seem to care One lie
I walked away weight on my shoulders was heavy
Barrel to my head

Will you give me a good excuse
Will you let me die right here and now ?
I can't think of another way
But I'm open to any good advice
Everything is falling apart
Trying hard to be strong and smart

One day was all it took
Start to get back on my feet heart begin to beat
One week I'm feeling great dancing around in the street
Feeling young and free

Will you give me a good excuse
Will you let me die right here and now ?
I can't think of another way
But I'm open to any good advice
Everything is falling apart
Trying hard to be strong and smart

It started as a whisper
Now try to dodge this roar
Unified, the most forceful way to go

Waste this one?
It's up to you!
We need this revolution

Destroy the pattern
Anything that separates
Across the times.
Who dares to follow?

For years we wandered these circles
Hold onto whatever lie gets us through

Design new latitudes
Find ways to channel bliss
Us defined, it's too fragile to neglect
Reroute to Remain
Reroute to Remain

Never want, to look back in greed
Can I please have your attention?

There are mountains to cross
For all that are willing
There are never ending treasures
That await you

I cannot frame, that's why I lose control
I aim, I stumble and I fall
Our adaptation can't be faithful
Your world does not attract me

This is the end you see
There is no more truth in me
As if you would deserve it
You are my enemy

I can't ignore the way you make me bleed
I hate when you throw my thoughts against the wall
Got to wake up and make a stand
The desperation forces another mistake

I count again
I know who to blame
My life in vain
Who said I was sane?

Follow your instinct
It usually takes you home
Don't let these words tear you down

You see me hanging
By the end of the rope
I tell you...

Slow I go
And the wait seems to be over
All that I know
Is that my life has become such a waste for you

I blame and run, sadly all too often
I dive into the day without your sympathy
I tend to try but lack the focus
Becoming a distant memory

What once was is quickly forgotten
All wrapped up inside
Delete all resemblance
I feel your relief

It's hard to believe
You could be such a disease
I can no longer separate what is real
Hope that fate will find me safe

All my reflections laugh at me
You made me hide my name
It just feels bad to say,
That there'll be another day

What you wanted was impossible to define
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright

What you wanted is a mystery to me
The words I hear are of scrambled letters
Guess it's been there for years
Never let me know, I was alright

Building a room with no doors
Is this the last of me?
Wring the rag for the last few drops
Falling into infinity

Have we lost the spark or a guide?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can't be too late to turn around
I need all the help from you

I need to find
Something to blame for a long lost time

I am running from something that I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

Is it dark or is it bright?
What's the latest on the screen?
Please tell me my name
I haven't checked it today

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today 'cause there's only a few
A sign of times my friend

My friend avoid infinity
Are you for real?

Just scratch the surface
And you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time

People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside
And you fear the next one

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill?
Or should I be left behind?

Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail?
With all that is given?

You crossed the line
You remembered my name
Time runs backwards
As we're heading that way

Consume all the obscene
Persuade the most hideous and ugly
Under every pile and stone
A rebirth, for you to find

Freedom is to be able
To go in any direction
So take the uncertain path

One foot in the open
Ten feet ahead
Build your own ladder
And don't lie to yourself

Secrets left above the grave (It's not for one to keep)
You're all so self destructive
Spend more time with the broken (see what became of their mistake)
You know you're lost when you feel transparent

Be at one with the wind
Even if it's a struggle
Make this your priority

Open all your senses
To new impressions
Act like all that was has vanished

The thoughts of yesterday forgotten
I like the way this new skin feels
Bring me splinters of tomorrow
Collect the parts where I win

Against the grain
Against the odds
I'll rise and I won't trip again
The dawn of a new day never looked
As good as this

Concrete breath and dust filled tears
A one way ride to inner peace
I never thought I'd join the others
Those who use the dice to solve

A mass illusion
Blind men in a line
They smother their fires with gasoline

A stranger's contribution
Everybody's on the run
No clue where they are heading

A spineless attempt
Have we lost it completely?
It always ends up in a mess

A liar's ambition
Praised like a king
Every day in every way
We are getting weaker

You won't go far
With the life that you're living
Every day in every way
We are getting weaker

Slow and calculated
Afraid of the sleeping
We'll never ever reach the goal

Drug me, infiltrate my never land
Like the floodtide drowning the shore

Drug me, you're all over me
Watch my blood begin to boil

I love that lullaby
Start me up again
Electric spine
Open mind

I leave you, negative behind
Watch me all in flames, on a butterfly I ride

Inhale the light
Relax for some time
The world outside stays numb tonight
Free your mind express the forgotten
The world inside is yours tonight

Please me, deliver the insane
In the chaos I find peace

Please me, remind the gods of my name
I believe there is one seat left for me

Will we find a solution
When we add all the numbers?
Like they are supposed to be?
But no is close... Start all over!

If we fail our expectations
We will fall into the deepest void
Is there a limit to how many times
We will dust ourselves off?

The mystery of time
Listen to me, carefully
The mystery of time
It's you and me
That's all we need

Would you choose supremacy
If it led to isolation?
Could you handle the solitude?
Would you still prefer the throne?

Mirror Mirror
How far will I go?
Despite the foundation I am falling
Sweet reflection
Will you save a place for me?

Where am I heading?
Could you grant me a haven?
For what?
I am punished could I ever repent?

Mother Nature, I'm wide open
Waiting for you to move me

Don't keep it from me
This is a free fall

I never seem to understand
The time, the place and who I am
Define a way to stay alive
It's like I'm living a lie

Father time every time I stop and feel
You're there to tell me I'm already late

Held down, strangled and abused
Cut down to half a member
Left with his hand tied
Everything points in the wrong direction

All the joy disappeared
The negative has penetrated
Once he was in control
What's left, the faintest laughter

We're out of focus, we've lost control
I blame our ego and you call me names

You're told that you are trapped below
And dark signs helped to prove
You got to reach further
For what life shall provide
Feeling pressure from the fold
He believes the dream is over
Drained blue eye, scorching fire
The whole meaning becomes undone

You stole my pure intention
You are the sickness in between
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You taught me to be sad at you
You almost made me take it all
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You bend me and you shake me
You beg me then you break me
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You made me feel like a sinner
Now you fear you'll die alone
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

The sickness that you are
The plague that made me starve
You think you can show me how I've come this far

I feel it's taking over
Everything falls dark
Break me open
The desperate cry

I am one with the world tonight
I am proud to be this far from you

You say that you have no regrets
But I know that you do
You told me someone stole the eye
I know him too

I've come to the conclusion, yes I know
That between black and white
There is no room for two
The scale it might be wide
But there's no need to be blind
Between black and white there is no room for two

I leave all the grey behind
I see clear, I know that I'll find

You claim that you are innocent
But tell me who ain't
You think that you're going to be saved
There's no such thing as a saint

Black and White
There's nothing in between
Black and White
Nothing's what it seems

It's not so much the pain
It's more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And curse my fragile soul
I scream to hide that I'm lonely
The echo calls my name

If I ever, If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see. Make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

The rain drops just beg to hit me
What now? Hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide-and-seek
I call on you to take me on
Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn all my efforts
In the end it means nothing

These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me free and

Leeches.
Like leeches
"In ignorance we trust"
If you say this way, I'll take that way
Fuel for the fire on which I thrive

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech (I know)
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts

Leeches, they preach to us
Words of wisdom from blocked minds

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech (I know)
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts

They make you believe your turn
The chance of a lifetime,
How does it feel to be alive?

A tear for the poet that can't be heard
(And) praise the artist that steals

Shot for shot
Many bullets penetrate me
Embrace me
Tell me stories of golden gods
The precision in your voice
Pierce the walls that I've built
Your eyes reach deep in me

Take a chance
They don't come much bigger than this
Dark star spend another day with me
A dead surface that doesn't reflect
The storm underneath
Take the chance
Bring me the calm

... And it leaves nothing

Expose the dark side,
Aching and emotional,
Expose the dark side,
Impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

Throw yourself into the eye of chaos
Infiltrate me,
Sneak out before I awake
Take out the trash and burn it
Try and find a beautiful place to lay
These fragile bones of mine

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

... And it leaves nothing

Expose the dark side, aching and emotional
Expose the dark side, impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

Save all your prayers
I think we lost today
There's no morning after
And no one's around to blame

I'm not afraid to bleed
But I won't do it for you
A star among hypocrites
The melody of our time

So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the earth
Scream your lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster!

What decides when you've lost the war
When the first man falls?
Or when they erase it all?

We're too numb to feel
The downfall starts right here
Hold your breath and swim
Swallowed my life's tear

In times of make believe
No one really seems to care
Maybe I should care less
'Cause I will die too

What will it take for us to realize
The more we provoke
Winter will come twice

Save all your prayers
I think we lost today
There's no morning after
And no one's around to blame

Scream you lungs out
Wait for laughter
You don't have to wait for ever
Here's the next disaster! 

We are ordinary people,
We all live different lives
In the end we're pretty much the same
We're just living in different lies
We just live in different lies!

They scream, You scream, I scream
We scream but no one listens

Abuse to feel superior,
Is it working for you?

They scream, You scream, I scream
We scream but no one listens

Abuse to feel superior,
Is it working for you?

We are ordinary people,
In a world build on stress
When we build walls around us
We end up in a mess

Rushing through thirty
Getting older every day... by two
Drawing pictures of innocent times
Can you add color... inside these lines?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live
In a dream... one more day

Sure it would change my perspective
I'm certain I would change today
I'm certain it would change our ways
Would things fall into place?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Just don't want to live
In a dream one more day

The yesterday we loved speak of tomorrow.
The burden of man is that time never takes a pause.
We live from Monday to Sunday but we forget what it means.
Then a ghost comes to visit and we tell stories from tabloids.

Call all your friends,
Watch fake photos
From a made up vacation.
Speaking in tongues about ancient artifacts.

We steal from beggars and ask for understanding
We lie, rape, steal and murder to make tonights headlines

Thanks
Nat
Trust the system,
Make your contribution,
Smile, applaud, love, hail.
The weaker you get the stronger they become.

Listen in silence,
Hear a voice.
How far are we ready to take this?

Listen in silence,
Hear a voice.
Before it all crumbles.

Lie, rape, steal and murder,
Smile, applaud, love, hail.

Gather in front of the TV.
Exploding sympathy.
The weatherman, our trust,
Our punctual company.

We steal from beggars and ask for understanding,
We lie, rape, steal and murder to make tonights headlines

Trust the system,
Make your contribution,
Smile, applaud, love, hail.
The weaker you get the stronger they become.

Listen in silence,
Hear a voice.
How far are we ready to take this?

Listen in silence,
Hear a voice.
Before it all crumbles.

Lie, rape, steal and murder, smile, applaud, love, hail.

Listen in a silence, hear a voice
How far are we ready to take this?
Listen in silence, hear a voice
Before it all crumbles

Compassion.
Confession.
It's all a compromise.

Dedication.
Domination.
Please define the lines.

Irritation.
Innovation.
Paired up to succeed.

Totalization.
Termination.
Fake smiles and greed.

Surrender to nothing.
Or run, as far as you can
I'm trying to hold on to what I believe in,
But my heart is in a coma!

Aggression.
Attention.
A need to be seen.

Directed.
Disrespected.
Stand in a line to be thankful
OBSCENE

Surrender to nothing.
Or run, as far as you can
I'm trying to hold on to what I believe in,
But my heart is in a coma!

The black hole forever mine.
I need fear.
Push me out
Oh be brave
Show me signs
Should I feel shame for the questions that I have

If you could be
The things I need.
I'll crawl through knives
An inch per tear.

These knees, they bleed for you.
Let the colour persuade the hate
That you fear.

Feed the lie.
Force the reason.
Leave me in doubt.
Need some motivation

It's in my hands.
The sky is so bright.
It's burning.
It's for me to decide.
If flames will reach heaven tonight.
It's in my hands.

Nailed to the floor
Paralyzed
Emotions drifting
Touch the new

If you could be
The things I need.
I'll crawl through knives
An inch per tear.

These knees, they bleed for you.
Let the colour persuade the hate
That you fear.

When all is said and done
We'll know what's right, what's wrong
But does it matter then
When all is said and done

When all is dead and gone
We'll know who lost, who won
But does it matter then
When all is dead and gone

See everything go
End of all things
The life that we know
Shift your point of view
You've been warned
This one way ticket is for you

When all the lights go out
We know what life's about
But does it matter then
When all the lights go out

When all that's left is lies
We'll see nothingness and realize.
But does it matter then
When all that's left is lies?

In a disaster story
A central conflict of primal rage
Usual sort of desperation
Characters remain the same

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

Walk on broken glass
Is the pain safe at the end?
All the elements in life's complexity
Make our struggle infinite

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

All the elements in life's complexity
Make our struggle infinite

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

(I cut you in)

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts as I cut you in

Vanishing light
The end of a compromise
In fury, in rage
A dream will diminish

Behind enemy lines
Learn to survive
Find a way to clone
Make friends and a place to call home

Take a picture and jump before we crash

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?

You're on the easy route
Money up front?
There's no doubt

Take a picture and jump before we crash

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?

It's so sad
But pay no mind!

Take a picture and jump before we crash 

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?

Find time and play with innocence
Like you ever would
I don't see you make any sense
I guess you deliver misery
Just like you should

1 o'clock and you paint the skies grey
It's not your fault We're the ones who betray
But how can you say it with such ease
You want to take a stand or just wanna please

Your bedtime story is scaring everyone
But you make me understand
The evil that man do
The evil that man do

This spectacle, our collapse
It's not a false alarm
The ashes settle in.

I guess, we are the insane
As we ignore the mirror's truth

Should I join the feast?
Should I acknowledge the leash?
A future in captivity
I'm not who I'm supposed to be.

Without even trying (killing the last scene)
Let this light explode.

The bleeding, we deceive them
Fuel the life that fades
At the height of reason
We shouldn live by your laws
Call the swarm
Feed them another false hope.

Without even trying (killing the last scene)
Let this night explode
Without even trying
Find the exit sign and disappear

Look at the dead outside my window
Wonder what's on their mind?
Why do they run?
They all seem to have a mission
But then they cry themselves to sleep

You receive what you give
And this is like nothing
I feel like shit
But at least I feel something

Is this all you meant to be?

Their marks in the pavement
You've walked this route too many times
What if I changed the signs?
Would you even take notice?

Is this all you have to give?
So... March... Straight jacket union...
So... March...
In chains - surrender

Hopeless times approach
Just give into the chaos
Strangely I find comfort here
Impatient and curious of what may come

...And so the rampage begins
Against the headache I can't win

Drain Me
Keep me in the dark
I don't want to take part
Prefer to be forever numb

Nothing great can come out of this
But I'm hostage to myself
I fear I might collapse on the razor's edge
And I fear I'll realize when it's too late

...And so the rampage begins
Against the headache I can't win

Sleepless again

I need to ease my mind
And kill what burns inside

Sleepless again

I can't win

The serpent knows,
When the curtain falls,
With denials blindfold,
He greets another day

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie,
A perfect ten,
When reality caves in
Don't tell me,
Tell my ghost,
'cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
I found secrets about life's undertow

Life's wrapped in a riddle,
Easier said than done,
Way to play the victim,
Rather run and hide.

Let them take me far away

Crawl back in place,
It's easier to cope behind the curtain,
Wipe the worries away
No thought about the consequence

Let them take me far away

I am my deepest shadow,
Something I can't ever neglect,
Rise above these ashes,
Or fall and fade away

In dark moments, I know better,
Within destruction, I see clearly

From here to new grounds,
Suppose I will be doing it alone,
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction

Staring into truth, I am the highway,
Existence, care for me in all
Your everlasting complications

In dark moments, I know better
Within destruction, I see clearly

Forget the promised land,
There was never an invitation,
Today I create my own,
Before there was sorrow
And lack of attention

Everyday takes figuring out how to live,
Sometimes it feels like a mistake,
Sometimes it's a winner's parade,
Delight and angers,
I guess that's the way it's supposed to be...

Please heal me, I can't sleep
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
Call me, everything, make me feel unbreakable,
Lie and set me free

I feel the fear takes hold
Afraid this hell I create is my own
Calm my franticness, I can't take it anymore,
This used to be my own world,
But now I've lost control

Chasing leftovers,
Under the fading sun,
Searching for shelter,
I feel my time has come

Consume the curse
That brings you down
(A fading liar)
Who wakes up alone

It's there
In front of you

Invert this tragedy to come
And reclaim your future
This is a call to arms
One quest at a time

Feed the hunger,
Climb on up
Repress the negative
You are not alone

It's there
In front of you

Avoid the mould
Desperate you regress
Move through me
I'll be your triumph

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure
Tell me which side I'm on
(Who's friend or foe?)
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying (slowly)

In many ways I'm the burden that devides us from the light
In many ways you're the halo that keeps my spirit alive

Temptation
Play the good or evil part
With me, you evoke the dark
Erase the free will and watch me heal

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying...

Amused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive I fly from here
But as the chosen pessimist

I carve my name in stone
I carve my name in stone

Amused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive I fly from here

How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith I'm dying...

Used to be original,
But now I tremble in fear
I am like everyone else
And that buries me

Is this how it feels
To reach rock bottom
Want to know how it feels to be forgotten?

I've become the distance,
I am the sober and irrelevant,
I don't feel part in this,
What is there to believe?

I'm not asking for much, just a moment
A chance to pick up the pieces
Happiness, please, come home

What if it ends right here
How do I change it?
Hoping to find a saviour
I've lost my way

Is this how it feels
To reach rock bottom
Want to know how it feels to be forgotten?
Hoping to find a saviour
I've lost my way

So restless,
These walls drain my thoughts
Room 307
Can't find my way out

It used to be my home
This cage, far from my comfort zone
Alive but without control...
Fear is taking hold

I should cross the line
Confront like the blind

Hear a distant cry...
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in
And discover the living?

I don't recognize my soul
Condemned to live in this black hole?
Dig within time... and crave what is mine.

I should cross the line...
Confront like the blind

Hear a distant cry...
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in

It's a hill to climb
Would be a dream if I,
Design a future and
Not the end of time

You won't
Find a friendly face in the crowd,
It's quite amusing to see how you suffer

I refuse, to let you steal my daylight,
Barely awake - but it strengthens my night rage
I've seen you kill many dreams,
But I got brand new armour,
And your weapons are way out of reach

How does it feel to be demolished,
Vaporized into thin air?
Strange new feeling to be nothing.

All the words I hear... they don't mean a thing
All drenched in fear,
And the hate you bring

Make me bother, I dare you,
I've got the strength I need,
But I'll await my darkest moment,
When the guilt doesn't get to me.

I used to adore you
The lies made sense somehow
Gave myself away without a fight
But the betrayal claims its price

At first I was scared
Not used to a murder's mind
But there was something beautiful
So powerful, so definite, so divine

Pushing the faith
Build out of rage

Falling ideals
Broken seals
March to the shore
You are a killer!

Is it something that's always been there?
Was it always destined to leave its cage?
I'm glad we met though
I love to release the rage

But everything has its end
And I've done my deed
The final bullet - always meant for me

Pushing the faith
Build out of rage

But everything has its end
And I've done my deed
The final bullet - always meant for me

Consume, just like a worm,
Catch a glimpse of the sun through cracks,
Everything, I swallow whole,
And hide before the flood.

The way I see things,
I wish they could be true,
But take me all the way.
The trail of the torment,
Is not a path anymore,
But take me for a ride.

Delete the past, the fear,
Delete the past, every step is pure,
Delete the past from here, forward,
Delete the past, every step is pure.

Afraid of lost control,
Still there's a part of me that wants to feel insecure,
Afraid of lost control,
It keeps me on the edge.

Delete the past, the fear,
Delete the past, every step is pure,
Delete the past from here, forward,
Delete the past, every step is pure.

The way I see things,
I wish they could be true,
But take me all the way.

Delete the past, the fear, forward,
Delete the past, every step is pure,
Delete the past from here, forward,
Delete the past, every step is pure.

We all find ourselves,
In honour of the good cause.
How empty we've become,
With our sight to be the true force.

Does every instinct say you're right?
I think sometimes there is doubt.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.

Lies and desperation lead us through as we're trying to be heroic,
I swept the world (?) to watch you manage.
Take a step back,
I'll tie you to it.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.

Hopes and prayers in pursuit of salvation,
Take a short cut, it only bends our cause.
But as far as I remember,
There is nothing that will get back the days you lost.

Does every instinct say you're right?
I think sometimes there is doubt.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.

We believe but we are deceased
Or soon to be.
I act surprised
You've seen the seas,
It's just enough to feed the trees.

We believe but we are not free,
This wasteland is our prison.
I act surprised?
I see the bones through your skin,
This radiation from within.

I grant you this torn land,
I'd rather not live here anymore.
Don't say I didn't try,
But I'd rather not live here anymore.

We believe but we don't see
The coming of the storm.
Why act surprised?
There are warnings from time to time,
Signs of our own decline.

We are the scavengers,
We plunder and rape,
We're the guests here, the new breed,
But act like it's ours to take.

I grant you this torn land,
I'd rather not live here anymore.
Don't say I didn't try,
But I'd rather not live here anymore.

We believe but we don't see.

I grant you this torn land,
I'd rather not live here anymore.
Don't say I didn't try,
But I'd rather not live here anymore.

I grant you this torn land,
I'd rather not,
Don't say I didn't try,
But I'd rather not live here anymore.

You can find all you need
The message is in the silence
Whisper words to calm your mind
Reach inside

Numb the pain

Come around with answers

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

Staring into bright lights
I am what I've done
It is useless to hide
An empty chamber
Guess I was part of a plan

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

We're running out of time
Can't seem to recognize
What put us here in the first place
Counting down the days, beginning of the end

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?...

Remind me I'm golden...
The fortress above the sun
Why don't you spend nowhere with me?
Follow the river and the path of the ones I name...
On the shore

Forever I can't find
Struggling in a world undefined...
Or destroyed
I don't want it to be
I'm not in to live

Fly into the distance
Disappear for a while
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today feeling alive

It starts to fall apart
Let me take control
Reminisce

This is nothing more
Something I will find again, deliver us
Deliver us

Can't hear the words you say

Does it really matter?
I'd give the world to you if you just

Fly into the distance
Disappear for a while
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today alive!

Fly into the distance
Disappear for a while
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today alive!

Until the world ceases to move!
A burning feeling, let me call, "This is real!"
I wish one more thing!
I flinch my hands and bang my head!

Take whatever comes to you,
All the while - I don't need another friend.

I burn when I do the things I do for you.
Forever the night, it's all for me now,
I'm sure that one day I can get you...
All that you lost.

I'm never told, "Bad I stay, so sick in me."
I'm dying alone.
We stand to fight for nothing!
Without a thought of reason!
We will never be OK!

I burn when I do the things I do for you.
Forever the night, and it's all for me now,
I'm sure that one day I can get you...
All you lost.

A growing pain, it is hard to say what brought the darkest burden.
For some of us there is no answer.

Chains are breaking, I regret this built up inside of me.
There's a storm coming.
I will serve no more, 'til my heavy last breath!

I burn when I do the things I do for you.
Forever, the night, it's all for me now,
I'm sure that one day I can get you...
All that you lost.

And I tried to think
Tried to paint the picture
I lived it all
Wouldn’t have to feel this way

Looking for something to believe in
I think I’ve done my time
One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

You can tell days by their faces
There is always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light

Keep pretending
I can handle everything
You’ll never understand me
And I don’t care what you think
Or maybe I do

At least you could have tried
It is way past time and we're scattering ashes
You take everything in sight, please hear me now
You are leaving me with scars

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We are losing identity
Faith has been denied
Let's not pretend
This is the first time we just don't belong

What world do you perceive?
Autumn cold, and no one cares for anyone
Waiting for the final blow
Do you have strength at all?
One more day, then we fade away

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We are losing identity
Faith has been denied
Let's not pretend
This is the first time we just don't belong here

the pictures slowly fades,
the walls are closing in,
and there I was, cursing the ground,
unable to understand

I won’t let the world break me
so I need to change direction
nothing special I'm far from perfect
light the way for me

I won’t say I’m sorry, I got what I deserve

feel I was running an endless mile,
last candle it burns
and I'm dying inside
all of this will turn to ash
a change for a piece of mind

walking where the dead ships dwell
these are shores I left behind
streets were getting smaller
and I have to leave

feel I was running an endless mile,
last candle it burns
and I'm dying inside
all of this will turn to ash
a change for a piece of mind

All I hear is noise
heart so false
so guess, I took it for granted
I know I went too far
I wont say I'm sorry
I got what I deserved
I got what I deserved

feel I was running an endless mile,
last candle it burns
and I'm dying inside
all of this will turn to ash
a change for a piece of mind

feel I was running an endless mile,
last candle it burns
and I'm dying inside
all of this will turn to ash
a change for a piece of mind

There's someone in the attic
Building a strange machine
Never really seen him
But I think he works all day
Blinded by the world outside,
I stay inside
Hardly know my name
But it's getting better by time

I saw something in the mirror
Someone's watching me
If I hide in the attic
He will never get to me
I found some rope on the floor
I have to build a trap
So I start on my machine
I am never to be seen

September's here again
Every insecurity reminds you
Who's at the helm?
Darker times
With fear in the eyes
Who's the man in charge?

Invented isolation
Alone and safe inside
Struggle with words,
That make sense in time
Yet waiting for someone to enter

Say, "I have a better plan"

Never have to worry
For all that we know
The truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in
For now it's fine
We're living the lie

When light breaks
Another way to matter
All questions somehow answered
When life comes crushing
At the early break of day
We've only come so far

How much can we take before we care to settle?
Thought we were set for a perfect scene
Everyone is waiting for a failure
Something I can't please and justify
The void within my eyes
Everyone is waiting for something they cannot have

Why don't you drop your guard
I'm on my knees
You got the mindset of a killer
And it will not take you far
If I had the answer would that make you stay?
This is the time and place it is your moment of fate

If this would be your last breath
Would it change a thing?
Dive head first into the fire

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me but believe me, I'm trying

What are you longing for?
What are you longing for?
What are you longing for?

If I had the answer
Would that make you stay
This is the time and place
You are waiting for something you cannot have

If this would be your last breath
Would it change a thing?
Dive head first into the fire

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me

If you just let me I'll find a way
To ease your mind and for you to stay
And I will untie all the ropes
It's hard for me, believe me, I'm trying

Twisting tongue

Fallen off the edge again
Need some space

Need disgrace

I'm confused I'm a maze

I need for you to pick me up, when I fall down
There's so much more

We can go far

But I can't control my selfish ways

Enter tragedy, slash my soul
Why is it a part of the plan?
Do you question me?

I question you

Who's the man in front of me?
I'm blindfolded, I can't see

Need a reason, I'm left empty
There's so much more, we can go far,

But I can't control my selfish ways

This inner apathy, brings me to life
I know it's strange and it's draining me
I'm tired, I'm fed up, I’m a Slave

I say goodbye to you all at once -

Don't dare to face you all alone.

I went from wreckage to world class with a box of t-shirts and some more records to sell

but times have changed - I have to defend my actions.

The foundation crumbles and I have to leave.

Thanks for everything - I couldn't ask for more...

I say I love you all... as I vanish through the Jester's Door.

I dreamed that you had died
I'm forever alone
I'm weakened, I'm frightened
This place's about to change
Things you said to me
Believe and the things you might find
Will turn into a march

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(Its moments like this)
I am what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Feel the sudden aches
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions
I swear to you it will never be the same
Its astray, but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(Its moments like this)
I am what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(Its moments like this)
I am what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Erase darkness from my mind
Last remaining night
From here to everywhere

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(Its moments like this)
I am what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

I know what it takes to break you

You know I never sleep
Just because you made them think
Doesn't mean the world will fall into place

Took some time but now you know
Tomorrow is too late

Close your eyes, walk with me, I'll set you free
And everything you ask for

I found a way
And I'm returning soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And will be, I will be with you
Tonight

If today was your last day
Would that change a thing?
You probably believe what you told them
Live each moment like your last

Well, close your eyes, walk with me, I'll set you free
And everything you ask for

I found a way
And I'm returning soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And will be, I will be with you
Tonight

I found a way
And I'm returning soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
I will be with you

I found a way
And I'm returning soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
I will be, I will be with you
Tonight

The fire
My heads all wired
In plain view
There's nothing in the way
I see with clarity
The eye of destiny
But just a little spark and once again... I don't know

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I've been hopelessly lost in the fear
Are you for real?

Are we the only ones?
It's all dark in here
Do I just waste my time?
Searching for exits in infinite space

All the lights
Is that the future or another lullaby?

Where I have nothing
Fearless and whole
Find out what you are
Back in time

No
I won't
I need this
Truth is.....

Once you had enough
Break out
Room to breathe
To love
Before you're gone

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down
Everything's gone

Where I have nothing
There's no hate
Room to breathe
No envy and nothing to lose

Vultures descend
Feeding on us
There's no sympathy

Breeding the hate

Turn away
Run away
From all the things we have to do

And it tears away our hearts and our soul

It's like we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
Rewind
There's no time
The wasteland.... It's an indication

We're only taking turns
Passing around the world
It's how it's always been
Out of excuses
Will we understand?

That we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
This time
We have found the wasteland

Out of excuses
Will we understand?

It's like we're on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
This time
We have found the wasteland

False affection took the best of me
Deep inside, the absent mind
Denial and hypocrisy
All in the same
To do this right we part our ways

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
Suddenly I know, I have to let it go

All has been lost
All has been won
Now I see it all right before me
Intentions are pure, I'm out of reach

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe

And I have wings
I have nothing and everything at the same time
Oh, a brighter sun
No more rain

Save me from my fears
The darkest thought I bare
Carry me through times
Through oblivion

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe,
'Cause now I know!

A fate that we deserve
There's no escape
We're walking backwards
I'm on your side
But life's a selfish thing
Like broken promises

A thousand times
Try to fake it
Just another liar

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't hate yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

How come we walk a mile
Just to shatter what we love?
Eyes wide open
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
Saying -You know you are heading-

The lost dream
Of what could have been
It makes no difference

How far until the edge?
These wrong ways are mine
But the whole world can just go to hell
This life is killing me
My feelings inside I can't explain
I'm awake, but not for long

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

I gave you the story of my life
Some of my precious time
But I'm tired of this
With every promise of eternal light
Another feeling dies

I'm right here,
When the world explodes,
Try to remember these words,
When the world explodes!

In the darkest of nights,
You are my endless fire inside,
Across the waters and back to shore,
There's space in time, you guide me.

Afraid there's not much time,
Life's a matter of moments,
Face the truth,
That I cannot run,
I always known.

So if I never get to say this to you,
You should still know, dry your eyes,
Find a stream that leads toward the water of the divine,
Come lay with me.

Face the truth, that I cannot run,
I always known (I always known)

So if I never get to say this to you,
You should still know, dry your eyes,
Find a stream that leads toward the water of the divine,
Come lay with me (lay with me)

So if I never get to say this to you,
You should still know,
Dry your eyes... dry your eyes.
Find a stream that leads toward the water of the divine
Come lay with me.

You want someone to blame
The one who drives the rusted nail
But who’s left will never care
Pretending becomes a chore
All you search for, a little piece of mind
Too far, too deep, the two faced smile
So lost, you feel, I know

Wide awake but still asleep
Always a stranger in a crowd (sleep, sleep, sleep)
Wide awake, always a stranger in a crowd (wake, wake, wake)

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
I’m there until the end of time

Leave the doomed behind
Search with different light
You were trying to remember
But it’s all make believe

You are, you are, you are

Wide awake but still asleep (wide awake but still asleep)
Always a stranger in a crowd

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
I’m there until the end of time

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want, I’m there

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
I’m there until the end of time

Throw it all away
Until we are erased
But it doesn't mean a thing

And I can't remember
What clear skies look like
Will I find out
That I'm late for salvation?

What if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away

This is my world now
I can't let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie
Dead eyes will see again

Gravity takes control
Don't forsake my troubled times
I'm starting to regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away

I will be reborn

I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will
I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will

Throw it all away
Afraid I will drift on the open sea
I regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don't let it slip away

Without the sense of space or time
The infinite
The endless static
The doubt. We never had a way

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I'm going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Tormented minds they wander
Drifting away from the light
I will lift you up my friend
You have to learn to breathe again

Unlock the secrets
Let us find the memories
Find ourselves some ruins
Turn them into something

You are lost within
Fading out
A world that threw you away

We're all in this together
Or so I was told
All for one, one for none

When it's time
You know this could never be justified
But still you take the hatred home

Or is this what you were searching for?
The wounded and it's filtered truth
Don't ignore a life that's real

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

You're battered against the world, you knew,
A place to hide from everything
And it had to make you fall

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wiped it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

The chase
A wild one
Has to become
Figuring out where you need to be
Find the pulse
Into with all you see
It's infront of you
Every other way
Leads to the same old great wall

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me

Sometimes it's hard to believe
The stories remain
I should just force right through
I guess it's for a reason
we waiting in line at the station

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me
Have faith in me

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me

I can see it all
against in my way
Before I end time
I close my eyes

It feels like a could find
a place in this mess
And I dream that I'm blind

And I'm weightless
when I become the sky

The earth, the moon,
the sun beneath me
This is letting go
I'm all over
I reach far and wide

I want to be the one
That believes
I feel like I'm
Part of this mess and I wish

That I'm weightless
when I become the sky

The earth, the moon,
the sun beneath me
This is letting go
I'm all over
I reach far and wide

The earth, the moon,
the sun beneath me
This is letting go
This is on my mind
When the world be mine
