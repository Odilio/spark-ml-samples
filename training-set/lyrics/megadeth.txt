Hook in Mouth 

A cockroach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes.
A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies.
A little man with a big eraser, changing history
Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees. 

Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue.
Make a person disappear, and no one will ever miss you. 

Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was.
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws.
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules.
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools. 

You say you've got the answers, well who asked you anyway?
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?
Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come.
I believe my kingdom will come. 

F is for fighting, R is for red,
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed.
E, we elect them, E, we eject them,
In the land of the free, and the home of the brave.
D, for your dying, O, your overture,
M, they will cover your grave with manure.
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me,
As long as there's a P.M.R.C. 

F is for fighting, R is for red,
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed.
E, we elect them, E, we eject them,
In the land of the free and the home of the brave.
D, for your dying, O, your overture,
M is for money and you know what that cures.
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me,
As long as there's a P.M.R.C. 

Put your hand right up my shirt,
Pull the strings that make me work,
Jaws will part, words fall out,
like a fish with hook in mouth. 

Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was.
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws.

I'm not a fish
I'm a man

Good Mourning. 

Hey, I don't feel so good.
Something's not right,
Something's coming over me
What the fuck is this?

Black Friday 

Killer, intruder, homicidal man.
If you see me coming, run as fast as you can.
A blood thirsty demon who's stalking the street.
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat.
Blood thirsty demon, sinister fiend,
Bludgeons slaughters, my evil deeds. 

My hammer's a cold piece of blood-lethal steel.
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal.
Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads,
Deviant defilers, you're next to be dead.
I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent.
Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head. Yeah! 

Their bodies convulse, in agony, and, pain.
I mangle their faces, till no features remain.
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds.
First take out the organs, then cut off the head.
The remains of flesh now sop under my feet.
One more bloody massacre, the murders' complete.
I seek to dismember, a sadist fiend.
And, blood baths are my way of getting clean.
I lurk in the alleys, wait for the kill.
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground.
I'm out to destroy you and ,I will, cut you down.
I see you, and, I'm waiting ,for Black Friday. 

Killer, intruder, homicidal man.
If you see me coming, run as fast as you can.
A blood thirsty demon who's stalking the street.
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat.
I lurk in the alleys, wait for the kill.
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground.
I'm out to destroy you and ,I will, cut you down. 

It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall.
Sweating Bullets

Hello me... Meet the real me
And my misfits way of life
A dark black past is my
Most valued possession
Hindsight is always 20-20,
But looking back it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction?
Nice story... Tell it to Reader's Digest!

Feeling paranoid
True enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me, and
My air is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things
I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit, and my
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets.

Hello me... It's me again
You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache
Thinking down to your level
Yea, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance
Mankind has got to know
His limitations

Feeling claustrophobic
Like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands and
I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things
I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets

Well, me... it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Some day you too will know my pain
And smile its blacktooth grin
If the war inside my head
Won't take a day off I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again

Feeling paranoid
True enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me
And my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic
Like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands and
I don't know where I've been
Once you committed me
Now you've acquitted me
Claiming validity
For your stupidity
I'm chomping at the bit
I'm sharpening the axe
Here I come again, whoa!
Sweating bullets
Problems 

Too many problems, oh why am I here?
I need to be me, 'cause you're all to clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely, you got no-one
You got your body in suspension
That's a problem, problem, problem
The problem is you 

Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want and you fade away
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five
It's too much fun of being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You work for me, living for the screen
Are you lonely, all needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated 

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh what what you gonna do, problem, problem
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Well, what you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you, problem 

I ain't death trip, but I ain't automatic
You work for me, just stay ecstatic
Don't you give me any orders
To people like me, there is no order 

Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem 

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh, what you gonna do with your problem?
I'll leave it up to you, oh problem
The problem is you, you got a problem
Oh what you gonna do?
They know a doctor, gonna take you away
Thay take you away and they throw away the key
They don't want you and they don't want me
You got a problem the problem is you
Problem, well, what you gonna do?
Problem, have you got a problem?
Problem, well you got a problem
Problem
Prince of Darkness


My victims are rich or poor, young or old, strong or weak
I cause millions of accidents, I am cancer in your bones
I fathered the lie, twist what you say, speak not the truth
I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes

I take what you love, and leave you in tears
I imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake I dance with the flames

I bring poverty, sickness and death
A worthless handshake, the slickest thief, I steal your wealth
I answer your prayers for greed and lust
More than evil, I laugh at your trust

I am more powerful than all the armies of the world
I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death
I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars
I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath

Evil, more evil than violence
Violent, more violent than death
Deadly, more deadly than man
I am yeah, yeah, I'm evil I am

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin
Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

I take what you love, and leave you in tears
Imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake I dance with the flames

Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the most beautiful angel
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness, unpredictable, the prince of darkness
Prince of darkness 
Liar 


You take great pride in never having lived up to anything
Lie, steal, cheat and kill, a real bad guy
Your daddy is a wino, and your mommy is quite insane
From alter boy to sewer rat, you don't give a damn
Your sister is a junkie, gets 'it' any way she can
Your brother's a gay singer in a stud leather band
Your girlfriend's got herpes to go with your hep and AIDS
There ain't one person you know you ain't ripped off yet. 

Look deep in the mirror, look deep into its eyes
Your face is replaced, a creature you despise
but I know what you're made of, it ain't much I'm afraid
I know you'll be lying until you dying day 

Make up your stories, truth's so hard to say
Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave
Your mind is sickly from Alzheimer's Disease
And decadence and debauchery killed your memories 

You're a liar, liar, liar, everyone can see
Liar, liar, [liar,] it's all you'll ever be
Liar, liar, liar, it's what you mean to me
Liar, liar, lies... 

Start trouble, spread pain
Piss and venom, in your veins
Talk nasty, breathe fire
Smell rotten, you're a liar
Sweat liquor, breathe snot
Eat garbage, spit blood
Diseased, health hazard
Scum bag, filthy bastard
Greasy face, teeth decay
Hair matted, drunk all day
Abscessed, sunken veins
Rot gut, scrambled brain
Steal money, crash cars
Rob jewelry, hock guitars
Rot in hell, it's time you know
To your master, off you go
You're a liar
A fucking liar
Filthy liar
Liar
You fucking liar
Liar
Devil's Island 



The light that fills my lonely cell,
Is blocked out by the key,
That locks the door to this hell,
The place they wanted me.
Time's racing like the wind,
Execution's near,
Oh lord, I wait for death,
And, yes, I have no fear.
I recall that night, my every breath,
And, step along the way.
Closed my eyes, walking,
As danger paved the way.
The devil, and the darkness
Let her evil wander free
And, here on Devils Island,
The final stop for me. 

Devils Island, Devils Island. 

Oh, there is no escape,
The sea is full of sharks.
The tide takes you away, and
Smashes you on the rocks.
The sun is shining,
But feel not today,
It's warmth, it's dying,
And fading away. 

Devils Island, Devils Island. 

Oh, hear the call,
From the grave beyond.
Oh, so pernicious,
Her soul it creates song.
As there is no man, that is
Here upon the earth,
Able to terminate our
Noisome will since birth. 

The priest that reads the sermons,
Is walking next to me,
To the stake, my last request,
To have her burn with me.
But, so it did, the heavens opened,
Rain began to fall.
The final judgement came, and
Was spread before you all.
Final judgement. 

Old, weak, and feeble,
But the lesson taught to me,
To stay away from evil,
She doesn't care for me.
She haunts me in my sleep,
Though I tore that page away.
And, here on Devils Island,
I'll always have to stay. 

Devils Island, Devils Island
Here I am. 

Devils Island, Devils Island
Looking Down the Cross 


Now before they take me
And my blessed life
Now you'll know why Death
Was summoned here tonight
I'll recall my perils
They'll kill me in pride
No, I can't run away
There's no place to hide
Though too much to live for
I owe enough to die
Ask not for salvation
My Death shall mean their lives
Hatred and guilt the alter they've built
High priests of sin
Destiny, fate the wicked ones gate
Beckoning you in
Down the walkways
Through the blood stained town
Looking down the cross
Bleeding from the crown
Led to stay
To die besides the thieves
Kill the king
Of the world to be
And now to you, this will come
A putrifying pestolence
More noxious than the serpents breath
Male violently destined
More corrupt than the malice of choronzon
More disease than the wind
Of the moonlight sun
Putrification you have caused
No need for confession
Now you wish you had a gun to stop the demolition
Swinging the judgement hammer
Man, woman, child no-one is safe
The heads of the dead are the banner
and this was all you got
So don these broken wings
Sands of time run out
Bells of Hades ring
Is this a nightmare
To unhallow thy name
Smell of brimstone
Dancing in the flames
No help now
As you fulfill his task
Chief of evil
Has got you by the ass
Set free
To sit upon the throne
Just a dream?
Your weeping all alone

Looking down the cross
(speak no evil)
I'm looking down the cross
(speak no evil)
My Last Words 

My life's on time,
But again my sense is late.
Feel a might unsteady,
But still I have to play.
Six to one's the odds,
And, we have the highest stakes.
And, once again I gamble with my very life today. 

Highly polished metal,
The oil makes it gleam.
Fill the terror chamber,
Your mind begins to scream.
Your life is like a trigger,
Never trouble till you're squeezed.
Now you crack a smile,
As you give the gun a tease. 

Place the piston down,
Now give the gun a spin.
Soon as the spinning stops,
Oh no, the game starts in.
A hateful way of vengeance,
A bit of playful sin.
Load another bullet,
Now the second round begins. 

A couple grains of powder,
A couple grams of lead.
A touch against the trigger,
A touch inside the head.
Take another drink, and
Raise the last bets.
Think about my last words,
They might be what I just said. 

A click comes from the hammer,
That couldn't drive a nail.
Sense the numbing cold blue,
Or the red of Hades' grill.
A fraction of a second,
Do you lose, or maybe still,
Pass it to the left,
And collect your mighty kill. 

Add another bullet,
The third round begins.
Soon as the spinning stops,
Oh no, the game starts in.
Please, no I.O.U.'s,
No markers for death.
Does anybody play? Anybody,
Somebody, anybody play. 

You, you, next victim, you next to die.
You, you, next victim, you next to die.
You, come on, next victim, your turn to die.
You, come on, next victim, your turn to die.
In My Darkest Hour 



In my hour of need
ha you're not there
and though I reached out for you
wouldn't lend a hand. 

Through the darkest hour
grace did not shine on me
It feels so cold, very cold
no one cares for me. 

Did you ever think I get lonely
did you ever think that I needed love
did you ever think to stop thinking
you're the only one that I'm thinking of. 

You'll never know how hard I tried
to find my space and satisfy you too. 

Things will be better when I'm dead and gone
don't try to understand, knowing you I'm probably wrong. 

But oh how I lived my life for you
still you'd turn away
now as I die for you
my flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
all these years I thought I was wrong
now I know it was you
raise you head, raise your face your eyes
tell me who you think you are, who? 

I walk, I walk alone
into the promised land. 

There's a better place for me
but it's far, far away
everlasting life for me
in a perfect world
but I gotta die first,
please god send me on my way. 

Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt be fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you, Alone so alone, I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
the pain, the pain, the pain. 

Won't you hold me again
you just laughed, ha ha, bitch
my whole life is work built on the past
but the time has come when all things shall pass
this good thing passed away. 

In my darkest hour.
Angry Again


The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips 

But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities 

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry ow 

And when the story takes a twist
If folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged 

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry 

The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away 

The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face 

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture it's jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air 

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again
And again and again, again 

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry ow 
Breakpoint


Make up the rules for me to live by
Rules you break and just let it slide
You try and find you inside of me
Be as great as you want me to be
Hypocrite, the word that fits
Do as you say
Not as you do 

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint 

Self esteem you seem to lack
Point the finger
There's three pointing back
Control's the illusion with all good intent
Bad times are contagious
You laugh and infect
Criticist, the word that fits
Put me down to lift you up 

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint 

Watching pain is your only pleasure
Sick fascination for someone's disaster
Self suffering since you were born
Mess with the bull and you'll get the horn
Misery, the word that fits
Can't seem to smile 'till someone's sad 

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me, push, push me
Push, push, push me to a breakpoint 

In my opinions as a professional I recommend
We straight-jacket the son-of-a-bitch
Lock him in a rubber room
Sedate him, heavily
And when he wakes up,
If he wakes up, we'll see
If he can be a nice boy 

Well... I don't know... It's gonna hurt me
More that it's gonna hurt him 

Let's do it! 

You push me to a breakpoint, breakpoint
Push me to a breakpoint, breakpoint
Don't push me, you piece of shit!

Madness comes, and madness goes
An insane place, with insane moves
Battles without, for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up, just breaking them in
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins
Never disclose, never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man, you're a murderer
Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all...Ooh...Oh you're a god!

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
Have you reached a verdict?

Yes, we have Your Honour, we find the defendant guilty!
On all counts for crimes against all humanity.

By virtue of the jury's decision and the power
Vested in me by the state I hereby sentence you to be
Incarcerated with no possibility of parole for life

Life?...Whadda ya mean life?...I ain't got a life

Boy!...Your soul better belong to Jesus!...
Hmmm-mmm cause your ass belongs to me!

Captive honour, ain't no honour

No time for questions
No time for the games
Start kicking ass
And taking down the names
A long shit list
A shorter fuse
He is untouchable
And guarantees you'll lose

Inside the bighouse
His nightmare unfolds
Before he got there
His manpussy was sold
Black blanket welcome
This tough guy's now a bitch
Praying for death
It can't be worse than this

Holy Wars... 

Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand

Fools like me, who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's command?

A country that's divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand

The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be your homelands

Holy wars

Upon my podium, as the
Know it all scholar
Down in my seat of judgement
Gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader
Out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier
Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
Behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die

They killed my wife, and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake... last mistake!
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
Next mistake... no more mistakes!

Fill the cracks in, with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't
Thinkin' it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Wanderlust


As sure as the sun rises in the east
Another gunman will come seeking my defeat
Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still
Will he fall like all the rest ending his days upon boothill

I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone

As I ride into the sunset to take another town
Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down
The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns
Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns

I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone

A drum beats for me, it's louder every day
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgment day
Life's an endless showdown never knowing when they'll come
I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun

The game I play has caused a lot of grief
They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief

I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land

I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land
I got wanderlust 
Tornado Of Souls


This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry
Not for the money, not for the fame
Not for the power, just no more games
But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a 1000 days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years, not from the use
Not from the tears, just self abuse

Who's to say, what's for me to say...be...do
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me
The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel
I warn you of the fate
Proven true to late
Your tongue twist perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death
Crush 'Em


Enter the arena and hit the lights
Step up now you're in for a ride
this is war, ain't no fun and games
we get it up, you go down in flames

Party time, going down
you better not mess us around
the stakes are rich, take a hit or stay
the price is high, someone's gonna pay

Heads I win, tails you lose
out of my way I'm coming through
roll the dice don't think twice
and we crush, crush 'em

Looking for trouble, now you've found it
you're a drum and we're gonna pound it

Last one standing wins the fight
hear us scream and shout all night
down on the floor and eat the grit
this is gonna hurt a little bit

Heads I win, tails you lose
out of my way I'm coming through
roll the dice don't think twice
and we crush, crush 'em

Now we lay you down to rest
you'll never be more than second best
step inside you're in for a ride
and we crush, crush 'em

Don't need reason, don't want names
just a John Doe to put to shame
step aside let me explain
the name of the game is pain

Now we've found you
We're gonna pound you
We're gonna beat you
Gonna defeat you
We're gonna bust you
We're gonna crush you
We're gonna crush 'em

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time
Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost
Personal Holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip
The heartland cries, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide

Now with new hope some will be proud
This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed, or dividend. Some may ask 'Why?'
You'll find the solution, the answers in the sky

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time

Holocaust
I'll Get Even

I'm lonely and abandoned
Washed up, left for dead
I'm lost inside the desert
Of ever word you said

Like a nuclear reactor
Or TNT
I'm thinking about the times
When you lied to me

All the innuendo
Caught up on your hook
I was just a name
In your little black book

Ah, I'll get even with you

I'm bitter and I'm twisted
I haven't slept in days
I'm lonely and I'm angry
I can't make it go away

I'm like a bomb that's ticking,
I got voices in my head
I got a doll with needles in
Wishing you were dead

I'll get you back somehow
That's what I'm gonna do
I'll get you back somehow
Your nightmare coming true

Ah, I'll get even with you
Ah, That's what I'm gonna do
Gonna get even with you

You better look behind you
'Cause there I'm gonna be
I'll be standing in the shadows
With who I used to be

He's slightly schizophrenic
Me and me and me and me agree
That you are gonna pay
For what you did to me

Ah, I'll get even with you
Gonna get even with you
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna...
Ah, I'll get even with you
Use The Man


I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust

Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
The fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man

Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in

He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in his hand
Cryptic writing on the wall, the beginning of the end
I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand
The Conjuring 


Welcome to out sanguinary sect of worship.
Feel at home in our black conventicle,
As we anathematise
All of those who oppose us.
Don't summon the devil,
Don't call the priests,
If you need the strength
The conjuring. Obey!!! 

Behold the flames rise
From the compass' cardinal points.
Burn the sacred oil,
And, with the ashes you'll annoint. 

Arrange the symbols,
Of the wizard, and, magician.
Light the candles,
Place the parchment paper in position.
Between its leaves place
The lash from a black cat's eye,
A straw of a broom,
Fold, and, burn, and, centralise. 

Don't summon the devil,
Don't call the priests,
If you need the strength,
The conjuring. 

I am the devil's advocate,
A salesman, if you will
You know my name. [You know my name] 

I met your father years ago,
Gave him what he'd please.
He called my name, you'll do the same. 

I'm claiming what is mine by right,
It's time to close the deal.
You're bought and sold, bought and sold. 

Come join me in my infernal depths,
Mephisto's hall of fame.
I've got your soul, I've got your soul.
The conjuring. Obey!!!
Peace Sells 



What do you mean, 'I don't believe in God'?
I talk to him every day.
What do you mean, 'I don't support your system'?
I go to court when I have to.
What do you mean, 'I can't get to work on time'?
I got nothing better to do
And, what do you mean, 'I don't pay my bills'?
Why do you think I'm broke? Huh? 

If there's a new way,
I'll be the first in line.
But, it better work this time. 

What do you mean, 'I hurt your feelings'?
I didn't know you had any feelings.
What do you mean, 'I ain't kind'?
I'm just not your kind.
What do you mean, 'I couldn't be president, of the United States of
America'?
Tell me something, it's still 'We the people', right? 


If there's a new way I'll be the first in line, But, it better work this time.
Can you put a price on peace?
Peace,
Peace sells...,
Peace,
Peace sells...,
Peace sells...,but who's buying?
Peace sells...,but who's buying?
Peace sells...,but who's buying?
Peace sells...,but who's buying?
No, peace sells...
Victory


Now, one day I started telling everyone
That 'Killing Is My Business...'
And I was hung like a martyr
For 'Looking Down the Cross'
My 'Skull Beneath The Skin'
Prophisied 'Last Rites/Loved To Death' my friends
Then I started seeing 'Bad Omens' in my head
'Good Mourning/Black friday' will I 'Wake up Dead'?
If I 'Aint Superstitious' then this won't mean a thing
But some crazy shit has happened since 'The Conjuring'

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a Victory

Came 'Anarchy' to 'Set The World Afire'
Pain of 'Hook In Mouth', 'In My Darkest Hour'
Corruption of the world 'Peace Sells...But Nobody's Buying'
Ignorant religion 'Holy Wars' and the dying, yea
'Tornado' nearly got me
By the 'Skin of My Teeth'
'This Was My Life','Forclosure of My Dreams'
May the past 'Rust in Peace' in 'Hangar 18'
And 'Countdown to Extinction'
Just be a bad dream
'Lucretia' said...
Rust In Peace... Polaris


Tremble you weaklings, cower in fear
I am your ruler, land, sea and air
Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My system locked in on military gluttons
I rule on land, air and sea
Pass judgement on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of hell
Will we give warning, only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head, to spit into the wind
I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload a mile high
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris, the end doesn't scare us
When will this cease
The warheads will all rust in peace
Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Survival such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps

High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea
Nuclear winter spreading disease
The day of final conflict
All pay the price
The third world war
Rapes peace, takes life
Back to the start, talk of the part
When the earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days where black as night

Eradication of Earth's
Population loves Polaris
Set the World Afire 



Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky
They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie
All forms of life die now the humans all succumb
Time to kiss your ass goodbye the end has just begun 

Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1989
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown into vines
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late 

The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid they said
And if it comes, the living will envy the dead
Racing for power, and all come in last
No winning first stone cast
This falsehood worldly peace
It's treaties will soon cease
No one will be left to prove that numbers existed
Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted
We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke 

Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy
and now the final scene, a global darkening 

Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruins
Towering overhead both far and wide
There's unknown tools of World War III
Einstein said 'We'll use rocks on the other side'
No survivors set the world afire
Take No Prisoners


Got one chance, infiltrate them
Get it right, terminate them
The Panzers will, permeate them
Break their pride, denigrate them
And their people, retrograde them
Typhus, detriate them
Epidemic, devastate them
Take no prisoners, cremate them

Going to war, give'em hell
D-Day, next stop Normandie
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit we'll win
War is peace sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A heaven for those who walk this world
Bereft of heart and soul
Love and war they say all is fair
Take his life
But won't take his hair
Your body has parts your
Country can spare
By the way son here's
Your wheelchair

He once had to be all he could be
Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you and me
It's a funny thing, a funny thing
Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you
Take no prisoners, take no shit
I'll Be There


I heard the voice of redemption
For me there is no exemption
I started praying

I heard the voice of satisfaction
Needing me for benefaction
I started pleading

I heard the bells begin to chime
Warning me oh lord
Don't let this be my time
Don't let this be my time

I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher
When nothing fits and nothing seems right
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you

You saw me slide, you saw me fall
We kept our pride through it all
We started screaming

When skies are dark, no sun shines through
I know I see the light in you
We stopped dreaming and started believing

I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher
When nothing fits and nothing seems right
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you
I'll be there

In my hour of need
You were there always
Now it's time for me to be there for you too
Always

I'll be there for you 
502

Pull over, shithead, this is the cops
Full tank, pockets lined with cash
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass.
Drive all day, and through the night,
Romance the road, winding left and right. 

The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free.
A feeling inside me, and the whole world to see. 

Driving fast makes me feel good,
The speed of light trapped under my hood.
Breaking laws, 'cause there's nothing to do.
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502 

Hundreds of miles rolled off today.
Signs lose their meaning, minutes tick away.
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all.
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol. 

Drive until daybreak, always on the go.
Life on the freeway, night shift till dawn patrol. 

Driving fast makes me feel good,
The speed of light trapped under my hood
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.
Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you. 

Stars above guide me
This feeling inside me.
I drive until daybreak.
Life on the freeway is Hell.
I'm coming through.
99 Ways to Die


If I see the morning hours
I'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow
Cause I've burned out my today 

If I get up to the top I know
I'll just go back downhill
Gotta' terminal future
And it's time to write my will 

Down another glass of courage
And a shot of thorazine 

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet 

Gotta' short between the earphones
Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave 

Ain't got no last words to say
Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind 

In a black tie and straight jacket
Man I'm gonna try again 


Demitasse of arsenic
Try on this tie
Never mind the tree 

There is only death and danger
In the sockets of my eyes
A playground of illusion
No one plays they only die 

There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break
I'm as mad as a hatter
And strung out just the same 

Taunting rigor mortis
I feel it draw me in 
Diadems


Sacriledge and blasphemy
Sets the stage today
The more insatiable the sex
The more swelled our tongues became 

As pre-historic as it seems
This is now, today
As pre-historic as it seems
This is now 

Talkin' 'bout no vision
Talkin' 'bout no dream
The Harlot puddles for her lies
From where she speaks 

I look above and see
Entrails in the sky
This song ain't over 'til the
Fat lady dies 

One man rules the earth
And rides the seven-headed beast
Ten diadems, to rule them all, to crown them all
The world, religion at his feet 

Dreams are told of dreams of old
This day will surely come
So, run my child and hide your face
Once you've been marked it's finished, done 

You'll become one
You're mine
You're one 

I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away
I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away 

Vengence is mine
Vengence is mine
The Netherworld and Sheol
Are never satisfied
So the eyes of Man are
Never sat-is-fied 

I saw a new Earth today
I saw a former pass away
Breadline


Ain't got no job
Ain't got no smoke
Ain't got a car
His life's a joke

Living on the skids
Thinks the world's just fine
Forgot what he did
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline

Forgot who he is
Forgot who he was
Used to call the shots
Now he can't connect the dots

A mover and shaker
Getting closer to his maker
Lower than a hemline
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline

Watch him dance

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline
About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline

No one, nothing, nowhere
Dancing on the breadline

He forgot and he ain't got nothing 
The Doctor Is Calling


The doctor is calling

Something's gone wrong
Nowhere do I belong
I listen to the voices in the dark room

Something's going down
But I can't make a sound
Looking past the bars of my mind

The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling

Always sharing trips
Remove me from your lips
Sight and mind still and never go away

One too many tantrums
Deviated symptoms
Better lock the phantom away

The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling
I see the chalkline crawling
I hear the doctor calling me away

This place is my home
My mind still runs free
The doctor's prescription
Less for you and more for me

The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling
I see the chalkline crawling
I hear the doctor calling me away
A merciful embalming
I hear the doctor calling me away 
Addicted to Chaos


Only yesterday they told me you were gone
All these normal people will I find another one?
Monkey on ny back, aching in my bones
I forgot you said 'One day you'll walk alone'
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head?

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

In a dream I connot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted to chaos

Light shined on my path,
Turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks, I smashed 'em
Cause I could
My brain was labored, my head would spin
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in
The rain comes down, cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown
Remember that you said
'One day you'll walk alone'


Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned...
The hunt is canned

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars anagram is 'lairs'
Man you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous...
So courageous


One hour from now,
another species of life form
will disappear off the face of the planet
forever...and the rate is accelerating

Insomnia


I'm running in quicksand
something's haunting me
the guilty past I've buried
my mind won't let me sleep

I'll do anything for peace - I keep waking up
a solemn oath I make
cross my heart please let me sleep - I keep waking up
how much more do I take

My head is talking to me
I don't know what it needs
but the loudest voice
is the one I heed

Insomnia, my swollen bloodshot eyes
Insomnia, awake till morning light
Insomnia, stirring deep inside
Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights
I can't sleep - insomnia

I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up
the madness I must tame
my candle is burning - I keep waking up
both ends again today

The whole house is creaking
I know they're out there
the things kept from sight
I beg to the shadows
I can't sleep

Insomnia, footsteps on the walk
Insomnia, I hear someone knock
Insomnia, I wish it was a dream
Insomnia, can you hear me scream
Go To Hell


I'm not going to wake up today
They've pulled my plug the picture fades
And as my body decays mold begins to fill my grave
The smell of death permeates the silk within my coffin lays
Go to hell 

As they bury me now six feet there my body lies
Still feel like I'm giong down I hear a distant wailing cry
God something must've gone wrong
And much too late I realize
Go to hell 

I saw my funeral that day
I know who didn't show to mourn
My judgement was life in hell
Pillars of pain and thorns
My only friend's the goat
With 666 between his horns
Go to hell 

Place all your trust here in me
Rest assured these things I know
And as Charon sails the sea
Your journey too shall end below
Ah yes you're all sitting ducks
It's true you reap what you sow
Go to hell 

Now I lay me down to sleep
Blah, blah, blah my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I'll go to hell for heaven's sake
Trust


Lost in a dream
Nothing is what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said

Tears filled my eyes
As we said our last goodbyes
The sad scene replays
Of you walking away

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

Time and again
She repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes
Another truth bends,
I must confess

I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again
But I wish I could trust

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

God help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
Now there's nothing we trust

How could this be happening to me
I'm lying when I say, 'Trust me'
I can't believe this is true
Trust hurts
Why does trust equal suffering

Absolutely nothing we trust
This Was My Life
Dave Mustaine


It was just another day
It was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right

There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can do

Lying on your bed,
Examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch
I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
Hey! This was my life
Hey! This was my fate

This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin

Now there's motives for the suspect
Now there's nothing left to say
Now there's method to the madness
Now there's society to pay


In our life there's if
In our beliefs there's lie
In our business there's sin
In our bodies there's die

This was my life
This was my fate

People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall

Melting down all metals, turning plows and shears to swords
Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war
Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here,
God have mercy!

Now we've rewritten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth


If you're fighting to live
It's O.K. to die!
The answer to your question is...
Welcome to tomorrow!

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy!

The Skull Beneath the Skin 


Mean and infectious
The evil Prophets rise
Dance of the Macabre
As witches Streak the sky
Decadent worship of
Black Magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon
trapped without a plea

See thing in agony
Necrosis is the fate
Pins sticking through the skin
The venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory
Nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life
But no one hears a sound
Hellpp Mmmeeeeee
Prepare the patients scalp
To peel away
Metal caps his ears
He'll hear not what we say
Solid steel visor
Riveted cross his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws
So no one hears his cries
The skull beneath the skin
Now your drawn and quartered
Your bones will make the x
Symbol stands for poison
And it's chained to your head
And as we fold your arms
To make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix
Religion has been lost
The skull beneath the skin 

Well, Here I come
Stand up and plant your feet
Listen I'm letting off steam
Now throw your hands in the air
Let loose I don't fuckin care
Solo-Poland 

Rattle Head
A dose of metal you need
To bang your head til you bleed
It's time for snapping some neck
Slashing, thrashing to Megadeth
Solo-Poland 

Rattle Head
You, Your head, is pounding with pain
Winning, sinning, beginning
Feeding, the needing for bleeding
Bashing, smashing, crashing
Fraying, annhilating you! 

There's someone back in the shadows
You feel though you can't see his eyes
He'll bash your head if you cross him
Ain't quite your average guy
Don't wear no leather to 'fittin'
Don't wear no spike to be 'cool'
Don't want no woman beside him
Just make it fast, Loud and Rude
Rattle Head 

I'm a Rattle Head
Rattle your Goddamn Head!
Almost Honest


I lied just a little
When I said I need you
You stretched the truth
When you said that you knew
Just can't believe it
There's nothing to say
I was almost honest, almost

Living alone, can't stand this place
It's four in the morning and I still see your face

I was nearly pure
When I said I loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said I'd bleed for you
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
You were almost honest, almost

Living alone, falling from grace
I want to be alone but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks

I question your call by the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice
It happened that night when you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know

Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest

Born from the dark,
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below,
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy,
Hit them in their sleep,
And when all is won and lost,
The spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead,
With mud and straw, blood and sweat,
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression

Ensuing power vacuum,
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire,
And the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face a kiss,
The other genocide
Time to pay with your ass,
A worldwide suicide

Born from the dark,
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below,
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy,
Hit then in their sleep,
And when all is won and lost,
The spoils of war are yours to keep

I like the way that I make you itch
And all the reasons I give you to bitch
And how I make you wanna scream in pain
And feel your life is just a losing game

I like the way that you let me in
The way you look when the walls cave in
I like the way that your stomach knots
And how you cry for it all to stop

I like the way that you fool yourself
And make believe there's nobody else
I like the way that you stand in line
And beg salvation from the empty skies

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reconing day

I like the things that you try to fake
And your face when I see you break
And that you say you will pray for me
You realize you are prey for me

I like the way you stay on attack
No matter what, I keep coming back
And how you try to hold me down
But you end up driven to the ground

Do it if you dare
Leaping from the sky
Hurling thru the air
Exhilarating high
See the earth below
Soon to make a crater
Blue sky, black death
I'm off to meet my maker

Energy of the gods, adrenalin surge
Won't stop til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high speed dirt

Paralyzed with fear
Feel velocity gain
Entering a near
Catatonic state
Pressure of the sound
Roaring thru my head
Crash into the ground
Damned if I'll be dead


Jump or die!

Dropping all my weight
Going down full throttle
The pale horse awaits
Like a genie in a bottle
Fire in my veins
Faster as I go
I forgot my name
I'm a dirt torpedo

High speed dirt...

Your bodies empty now
As I hold you
Now gone I miss you
But I told you
I remember bad times
More than good
There's no coming back
Even if we could
I loved you to deth
If I can't have you
Than no one will
And since I won't
I'll have to kill
My only love, something
I've never felt
Now you've gone to heaven
And you'll burn in hell
I loved you to death 

And now I'm down below
And what do I see
You didn't go to heaven
Your down here with me
And now coming back,
Baby, take me, please!
I really think I would
If you weren't such a sleaze
I loved you once before
You kept me on a string
I'd rather go without
Than take what you would bring
I loved you to deth
Mastermind


Anonymous existence, rendered useless to mankind
Destroy the logic volume in the confines of the mind
Enmassed and purposeless, marching in a perfect line
Neo-neuro torture, mental meltdoen, a heinous crime

Mastermind, I tell you what to think
I tell you what you need
I tell you what to feel

Invade the core of souls to wipe the lives away
Design vacant beings, welcome the inhuman race
Encrypted horror codes, directive psyche overwrite
Processing brains to pabulum,
Delete and format living drives

I tell you what's real

Hail to the power age, lest the viral hour comes
Raise the flag of voltage, bow to circuitry unknown
Kneel before the processor, lords of static laugh
Electrons in submission, you must know who I am

I tell you what to think
I don't care what you thought
I tell you what to get
I don't care what you got

Forgive me father for I have sinned
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
And I'm still awake... Mary Jane 

From the earth, up through the trees
I can hear her calling me
Her voice rides on the breeze
Oh, it's haunting me 

No, I can't get away
No, there's no escape
If I know I'm going crazy
I must not be insane 

Beware my friends, as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I am now so you must be
Prepare my friends to follow me 

Forgive me father for I have sinned
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
Fingers gripped around my brain
No control, my mind is lame
I'm in the astral plane, and I'll never be the same
Never, never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never 

It hurts so bad I can't breathe
Prepare to follow me

Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone that's all

To all the world
To all my friends
I love you
I have to leave
These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say

Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living are scarred
These Boots 

You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love, but I call sex
You've been kissing when you ought-a-be-a
Screwing and now someone else can
Kiss your ass
These boots are made for walking
Thats just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you 

You keep lying and there ain't no believing
And you keep stayin when you ought-a-be-a leaving
Now what's right is right but you ain't been 

Right yet
These Boots... 

You keep dressin ways you shouldn't

And you keep thinking that you'll never
Get burned Ha!
I just found me a brand new Box Spring
Mattress
What you know bitch you got a lot ta learn
These boots... are you ready boots

And you think I'm kiddin, Don'tchya!
Anarchy in the UK 

Right now
I am an Anti-Christ,
and I am an anarchist.
Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it,
I want to destroy, possibly? 

Cause I want to be Anarchy. No dog's body. 

Anarchy for the U.K.
It's coming sometime it maybe.
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light.
Your future dream is a shopping spree. 

Cause I want to be Anarchy, in the city. 

Of many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest.
I use the enemy,
I use anarchy. 

Cause I want to be Anarchy, it's the only way to be. 

Is this the M.P.L.A.?
Is this the U.D.A.?
Is this the I.R.A.?
I thought it was the U.K., or just another country
and other cunt-like tendencies.
Cause I want to be Anarchy, cause I want to be Anarchy,
you know what I mean? 

Cause I want to be an Anarchist, again I'm pissed, Destroy! 
Bad Omen 

Down fell the stars, as they
Splashed into the sea.
Come dance with me.
Sacrifice the virgins,
Spiritual rites.
Their master's time has come,
The moon is full tonight. 

Drinking, dancing,
They worship, and toast
The devil, who's watching,
With demon's remote.
Fire, rising,
Racing in your blood.
Possessed, naive,
His service is done. 

Bloody blasphemy. 

Sinister's the word,
As the demon's take their fill.
An orgy's taking place,
Human blood will spill.
An act of worship,
As they conceive the ghouls.
Satan has their souls,
They sing pagan tunes. 

The ceremony,
Is sure to be cursed.
They ask for his blessings,
But, down comes the worst.
Their bodies, soulless,
A corpse from the grave.
Their minds are helpless,
And, no-one can save
No-on can save them
Blood of Heroes


Walking stiff let me tell ya
Better left for dead
And now we are on a mission
Well it's full speed ahead
My legion's when we do the crime
Let's get one thing straight
To get there early is on time
And showing up on time is late

Ladies and gents, we're still alive
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time
Angel in our pocket, devil by our side
We ain't going nowhere cuz' heroes never die

Still alive
Blood of heroes
Never die
They never die

We've been run down every hill
Chased up all the dead end streets
But if you try to cut us out
You'll get a kick in the teeth

Ladies and gents we're still alive
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time
Fasten up your head belts,
Time to ride the skies
It's time to be immortal, 'cuz heroes never die
Black Curtains


Hey... look around you
Everything's helter-skelter
Listen up... I warn you
Run for cover, run
Bang... it happened
Time's up, armageddon
Fire... meltdown
The sky is crumbling in

Black curtains... never ending

Escape... you're joking
Can't find no place to run
Hair... is burning
My flesh is bubbling up
Blood... is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue
Fate... is coming
Welcome it with a smile

Black curtains... never ending, fall

Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom in a spider's web
Suffocating, no one hears my calls
Never ending, till the black curtain falls

Snakes... surround me
Offering their death kiss to me
Down... I'm drowning
How long, I hold my breath
Dogs, are chasing
My legs are paralyzed
Pray... don't find me
My life is fading fast
Chosen Ones 


You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For Death surely wants you
With sharp and pointy teeth
An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen one
Human bones blanket the dirt
of the heathens lair
That we must pass this den of death
The only path from here
But I walk in the light
The time to die has come
No one shall take my life
I'm of the chosen ones
Black shadows till the sky
As the creatures eyes grow near
Raise the shield of the holy pilgrims
High into the air
Heavens powers fill my arms
Onward now to fight I'm sent
Oh the beast is coming
To put you to the test 

Lookout!
Now this land is mine to pillage
Rape, and steal, and take at will
Never let you cross this path
I reign, for now, I say to Kill
FFF


Looking for a cure within the human race
Eliminate the poor, how much longer will it take
Burning up the tents of the rank and file
Exterminate their lives, crack a demon smile

Crushing down, caving in our will to live
Getting rid of man's mistakes
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down
How much more can we take

Fight for freedom, fight authority
Fight for anything, my country tis' of me

Cry for absolution, it's not the end for me
A last minute pardon, one final reprieve
Resist the war maching, don't get in its path
Fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath

Crushing down, caving in our will to live
Getting rid of man's mistakes
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down
I don't know how much more I can take

Fight!... It's my country

I had wrists donning slits
Flowing constantly
My broken body in a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit and run
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth

My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser of my room
My wet brain neighbor cranes
His neck to see in time,
The white lights a train
Bearing down on me

I won't feel the hurt
I'm not trash any longer
That that doesn't kill me
Only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue
That's what 911 is for
So, tag my toe and don't forget
Ooh to close the drawer


Who'd believe with the way things are here
We'd be going anywhere telling people
How to live?
Who'd believe we'd spend more
Shippin' drugs and guns
Than to educate our sons? Sorry but
That's what they did

I can't help but think,
Someone's foresaken you and me

Luck deserted me and the truth
Beat out my brains
Men rise on stepping stones of their
Selves to higher things
I've stepped over lots of bodies on my way
Thanks for the information don't need no
More anything

We are the damned of all the world
With saddness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia
No More Mr. Nice Guy


I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see 

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' shot down
And I'm feeling mean 

No more Mister nice guy
No more Mister clean
No more Mister nice guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene 

My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eye
My mom's been thrown out of the society circle
My dad's had to hide
I went to church incognito
And everybody rose, the reverend Smith
He recognized me
Punched me in the nose 

No more Mister nice guy
No more Mister clean
No more Mister nice guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene
Train of Consequences


I'm doing you a favor
As I'm taking all your money
I guess I should feel sorry
But I don't even trust me
There's bad news creeping up
And you feel a sudden chill
How do you do? My name is Trouble
I'm coming in for the kill...
And you know I will

Set the ball a-rollin
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life o' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

No horse ever ran as fast
As the money that you bet
I'm blowing on my cards
And play them to my chest
Life's fabric is corrupt
Shot through with corroded thread
As for me I hocked my brains
Packed my bags and headed west
Poison Was The Cure


I miss the warm embrace I felt
First time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known you'd crush me
A snake you were when we met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poisoned fangs
The venom never goes away
Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackyl speaking with tongue
Roach egg laying in my brain
Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
Til I finally threw the towel in
Never knowing if I'd wake up in a
Whirlpool got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood
In a cesspool I became dead
From a rock star to a desk fool
Was my destiny someone said
Loves a tidepool
Taste the waters life's abundant
Taste me
Have Cool, Will Travel


Mamas pack their lunches, kiddies pack their guns
Wishing it will go away, but nothing's getting done
A shot heard 'round the world, when a mother's baby dies
We the people, point our fingers, blame and wonder why

Face it and fight or turn high tail and run
'Til it comes back again just like the rising sun
Say they do all they can, it's just another lie
The answer's plain to see, nobody wants to try

There's no recess and no rules in the school of life
If you listen very closely you'll see what it's like
Have cool, will travel

Tell myself it ain't true, they just cannot see
Grown up or sewn up, the medicine's worse then the disease
I have cool, will travel
Here we go
Family Tree


Forgotten things remembered
The tigers eat their young
The body stayed but inside the head
The mind was on the run
A conspiracy of silence
The only way out of pain
Is turn around, run through it man
Too wet to come in from the rain,
Tell them...

I know they were doing it to you
But don't try doing it to me

Let me show you, how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
But keep it in the family tree
The secret of the family tree

When you hear them saying 'trust me'
Don't wait to see what's next
Thrown to the wolves
Forever trusting
Raised in a form of living hell
Sing a one note song of rage
Live and die within your heart
So beware in the shadows

Your family tree waits in the dark
I say...
Lucretia


Sitting up late at night
I tiptoe through the darkness
Cold as hell black as spades
Aware of my immediate surrounding
In my place I escape
Up into my hideout
Hiding from everyone
My friends all say
Dave you're mental any way hey!
Drift into a deeper state
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways
Dirt grits beneath my feet
The stair creaks, I precariously sneak

Hypnosis guides my hand
I slipslide through the walkways
Sit in granny's rockin' chair
Memories are whirling by yeah
Reminisce in the attic
Lucretia waits impatiently
Cobwebs make me squint
The cobra so eloquently glints
Moonbeams surge through the sky
The crystal ball's energized
Surely that like the cat waiting
Lucretia rocks away
Seven


Full of greed you sell your soul
Full of pride a heavy load
You eat yourself gluttony
Resent yourself you envy me

Everything turns into wrath
You lust yourself to death

Deep fears that drive us
Hid beneath disguises
Judge the world within
Forgive my deadly sins

Procrastination always giving up
Something better comes to interrupt
Cast your verdict down to me
Spare me your bleeding sympathy

Only care how you appear
Clearly see you can't see clear

Deep fears that drive us
Hid beneath disguises
Judge the world within
Forgive my deadly sins

Greed, gluttony, pride, envy, wrath, sloth, death, deadly seven
Seven deadly sins of mine

On every street
And corner lie
These seven deadly sins of mine
Ecstasy


You live in a world of fantasy
You live in a web of deceit
You want it all including me
You like it all to be neat

I come to you when shadows fall
I leave as the dawn arrives
Hide the truth to deceive them all
How my good intention lies

Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring ecstasy

Secret meetings that we hide
Deeds of iniquity
The price of foolish pride
The cost of immorality

And we hide the truth to deceive them all
And the pain of what will never be

Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring ecstasy

Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes
I hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods
On judgement day
A blink of an eye between
The cradle and the grave

One last look at visions of flesh
The last best hope of man on Earth
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands
The world don't want to be saved
Only left alone

Elysian Fields...
We are storming the heavens
We raise the swords and shields
We ascend to our destiny
To the Elysian Fields

Soaring to the sun
With blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief,
One decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms
Is like cancer to their bones
I Thought I Knew It All


Somewhere there's a reason
Why things go like they do
Somewhere there's a reason
Why somethings just fall through
We don't always see them
For what they really are
But I know there's a reason,
Just can't see it from this far

Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice

I thought I knew it all
I thought I had it made
How could it end this way?
I thought I knew

Somewhere there's a reason
Why things don't go my way
Somewhere there's a reason
That I cannot explain
Just like the change of season,
Just may not be my turn
But I know there's a reason,
The lesson's mine to learn
Time: The Beginning


Father time, I'm running late
I'm winding down, I'm growing tired
Seconds drift into the night
The clock just ticks till my time expires

You were once my friend
Now I know I can't tie your hands
The days I saved I couldn't spend
They fell like sand through the hourglass
No time to lose, no time to choose

Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one
Not even me

An enemy I can't defend
My final place a deadly end
Life's just a speck in space
Dreams of an eternal resting place

I can't get any younger
Time has brutal hunger 
Five Magics


Bestow upon me knowledge
Wizard - all knowing all wise
I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze now defiled
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin
Parade the grey robed monks
The vestal virgins,wheel the wyvern's in
Let the ceremony
consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protege
Of five magics
Give me alchemy
Wizardry
Sorcery
Thermatology
Electricity
Magic if you please
Master all of these
Bring him to his knees
I master five magics

Possessed with hellish torment
I master magics '5'
Hunting the abyss lord
Only one will stay alive
He who lives by the sword
Will surely also die
He who lives in sin
Will surely live the lie
Paranoid


Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with
my mind
people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify 

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah 

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind 

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me us so unreal 

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
Killing is My Business...And Business is Good! 


I am a snyper
Always hit the mark
Paid assassin
Working after dark
Looking through the night
Using infra-red
My target on you
Aimed at your head
$10,000 up front
$10,000 when I'm through
And I know just what to do
And ya know I'll do it too
Then I'm coming back for you
Back for you!
I do the 'getting rid of'
Don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth
Don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly
And now we're through
It brings me great pleasure
To say my next job is you
Don't you know that
Killing is my business
And business is good (Repeat)
You'd better believe it

The mother of all that is evil
Her lips are poisonous venom
Wicked temptress knows how to please
The priestess roars, 'Get down on your knees'

The rite of the praying mantis
Kiss the bones of the enchantress
Spellbound searching through the night
A howling man surrenders the fight

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

My desires of flesh obey me
The lioness will enslave me
Another heart beat than my own
The sound of claws on cobblestone, I'm stoned

Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her mystic lips tell only lies
Her hidden will to kill in disguise
I Ain't Superstitious 


I ain't superstitious,
When a black cat crosses my path.
And, I ain't superstitious,
As I break the looking glass.
Ain't afraid of no demons,
Don't make me laugh!
I ain't superstitious,
Under the ladder I go.
I ain't superstitious,
It's all bullshit, don't you know!
Ain't afraid of the shadows,
I like the dark anyway, and that's a fact!
Superstitious 

I ain't superstitious,
No such thing as bad luck.
I ain't superstitious,
I couldn't really give a fuck.
Take your stupid superstitions,
And find some other paranoidal,
Chickenshit, sissy, worm, and, tell it to him.
Superstitious 
Sin


He had an unfamiliar face
Complete life in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin

Not one to be forgot
Spoiled rotten, so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Pressure coming down
Down on me, gonna break
Broken fingernails
Digging in, scratch my face

Nervous, like a cat
Gonna jump through my skin
Shadows on the wall
Stretching out, grope for me

Reasons, deep in me
Let me be
Let me bleed
Set me free
The reasons that we sin
Mechanix 


Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
Your a burner yeah a real motor car
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you
Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank
Made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearing melt from the heat
We were shifting hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end you know it feels to slow
I'm giving you my room service
And ya know it's more than enough
Oh one more time ya know I'm in love
A Secret Place


There's a secret place I like to go
Everyone is there but their face don't show
If you get inside you can't get out
There's no coming back, I hear them shout

Welcome to my hide away, my secret place
How I arrived I can't explain
You're welcome to, if you want to stay
But everyone just runs away

Let me in, get me out
Can't do more then twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
Found it again in my secret place
In discrace

I hide from those that try to find me
Scary things that's right behind me
I lost myself, I must confess
I can't explain how I got this mess
The Killing Road


Again we stalk the stage
At mach speed we engage
Feeding people's rage
The big cat's left it's cage
Back in the bus again
To catch another plane
This behavior's quite insane
But we do it for the fame, yeah

I lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

The road will never end
It always starts again
Another show's around the bend
Another long lost friend
Faceless as the snow
There's nothing special about the road
It's just another haul
It's just too damn long that's all, yeah


Assassin in stealth
Assailant from Hell
Impervious to damage
Computer on-board
Engaged in a war
Non-stop combatant
Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man

Part bionic
And organic
Not a cyborg
Call him Psychotron

Burning inside
Godspeed in glide
Battle plan running
A killing machine
Just downright mean
And forever gunning
Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man


Target to destroy
Arms in employ
Full assault fire threat
Sensors indicate
You will terminate
Life systems disconnect


Psychotron
The Disintegrators


The slayer's arrived
On a black horse of steel
Trouble is coming
Hell on two wheels

Hide in the shadows
Awaiting defeat
Or live by the sword
And choose to be free

We say retribution
We say vengeance is bliss
We say revolution
With a cast iron fist

Coming down the road
Watching every move
Kicking in the doors
Taking what we choose

Anarchy's coming to town
A fiery invader
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

Anarchy's coming
Here it comes
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators
Symphony of Destruction
Dave Mustaine


You take a mortal man,
And put him in control
Watch him become a god,
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes,
Swaying to the Symphony...
Of Destruction

Acting like a robot,
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse,
Before the head explodes
Explodes…

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens,
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall...

Hangar 18


Welcome to our fortress tall
Take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For you see the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly I've seen to much
Hangar 18 I know too much

Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed foretold but who'd suspect
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen to much
Hangar 18 I know too much
Vortex


Internal combustion
Multiple personalities
Terror inside of me
A mask of silent agony

Curse the falling rain
The vortex of pain

As medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Lucifer in transition
It's time the price was paid

Searching the domain
The vortex of pain

A telestic message
Writtin in torment
Howl out dirges
Like the horns of Jericho
Distorted faces
Writhing in rage
Walls of purgatory
Tumble down
Endless death
The jewels of a crown
Dawn Patrol


Thermal count is rising
In perpetual writhing
The primordial ooze
And the sanity they lose

Awakened in the morning
To more air pollution warnings
Still we sleepwalk off to work
While our nervous systems jerk

Pretending not to notice
How history had forebode us
With the green house in effect
Our environment was wrecked

Now I can only laugh
As I read our epitaph
We end our lives as moles
In the dark of dawn patrol
Wake Up Dead 



I sneak in my own house
It's four in the morning
I had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed,
I know if I wake her,
I'll wake up dead 

I wonder, will she find out,
About the other, other lover.
Diana. 

Wake up dead, you die
Wake up dead, and buried.
Wake up dead, you die
Wake up dead.
Time: The End 


I see Chronos
His eyes are on fire
He holds my life
And I see my time expire

Beat the clock
My head starts to spin
Tick, tock
I can't let time win 
Enter the Arena


'Here we go... crush, crush, crush 'em...'
Into the Lungs of Hell
