With a fever, but nothing he found

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin' to keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin'

Still they hate you, you're a vegetable
You're just a buffet, you're a vegetable
They eat off of you, you're a vegetable

Billie Jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders

Lift your head up high

No one can hurt you now
Because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me
So you believe in you
Help me sing it, ma ma se
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa,
Ma ma coo sa

I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave here everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me
And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(Who is it?)

As I, turn up the collar on
my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
with not enought to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard,
a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his wa
Ys
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me,
pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken h
Eart
And a washedout dream
(Washedout dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

No message could have been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)

(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your... your mind!
(Then you close your... mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man,

Who's bad? 
I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries remain
And now I wonder why
I breakdown when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie
(Is it just a lie)

I try so hard to love you
Some things take
Time and shame
I think the whole world
Of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this thing
Come true
(Make this dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging
On my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl
That got away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let it be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye
(Still you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will
Have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who
Set you free

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let

I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away
I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries remain
And now I wonder why
I breakdown when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie
(Is it just a lie)

I try so hard to love you
Some things take
Time and shape
I think the whole world
Of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this thing
Come true
(Make this dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging
On my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl
That got away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let it be
But evertime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye
(Still you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will
Have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who
Set you free

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

Can't let go
Can't let go

I can't let
I can't let her get away

They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

Nation to nation
All the world
Must get together
Face the problems
That we see
Then maybe somehow we can
Work it out
I asked my neighbor
For a favor
She said later
What has come of
All the people
Have we lost love
Of what it's about

I have to find my peace cuz
No one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother
There'll be problems,
Time and tears for fears,
But we must live each day
Like it's the last

Go with it
Go with it

The world keeps changing
Rearranging minds
And thoughts
Predictions fly of doom
The baby boom
Has come of age
We'll work it out
I told me brother
Don't you ask me
For no favors
I'm conditioned by
The system
Don't you preach to me
Don't scream and shout

She pray to god, to buddha
Then she sings a
Talmud song
Confusions contradict
The self
Do we know right
From wrong
I just want you to
Recognize me
I'm the temple
You can't hurt me
I ofund peace
Within myself

Go with it

Smooth criminal

'Scream'(feat. Janet Jackson)
Tired of injustice and im
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting
So what does it mean
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, dammit
Hee, heeheeheee

Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(Janet)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make you just wanna scream

Tired of you tellin' the story your way
It's causin' confusion
You think it's okay

You Keep changin' the rules
While I keep playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(Janet)
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie
Oh father, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop shittin' with me
Make me wanna scream

'Oh my God, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice'
'All the injustice'

'A man has been brutally beaten to death by
Police after being wrongly identified as a
robbery suspect. The man was
an 18 year old black male...'

With such collusions don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother please have mercy 'Cause I just can't take it
Stop pressurin' me

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust

They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money

So you go to church
Read the holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd

They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money

You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the 'Just Few'
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...

If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it

You do anything for money...

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
Cuz your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money

Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Then watch the ones
With the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers...
Cuz they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it

You do anything for money...

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

You say you wouldn't do it
For all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man
Then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie
Then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God
Then you will hell him

You do anything for money

Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you
God I need you
I love you so much

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name...
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawling
Heaven's glad you came...

You know how I feel
This
thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps,
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

I just can't hold on

I feel we belong

My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I
Just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop...
Then tell me just what will I do

'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true...

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying
'I do'

'I do'
This thing can't go wrong

This feeling's so strong

H]
Well, my life ain't worth living

If I can't be you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop...
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow

We can sing songs of yesterday

I can say, hey... farewell to sorrow

This is my life and I,

Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you

No, baby

Oh!


I just can't stop loving you

If I can't stop!

And if I stop...

No

Oh! Oh! Oh... Oh...

What will I do? Uh... Ooh...
(Then tell me, just what will I do)

I just can't stop loving you

Hee! Hee! Hee! Know I do girl!

I just can't stop loving you

You know I do
And if I stop...

Then tell me, just what will I do 
Ther's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place...

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try
We shall see
In this bliss
We cannot feel fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world...

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth
Crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place...

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

You and for me
You and for me
You and for me
You and for me
You and for me
You and for me
You and for me
You and for me
You and for me
You and for me 
The way she came into the palce
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
She said don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
And left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of lvoe
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
And said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous

I cannot sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

She's so dsngerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

(Ad libs out) 
Told me that you're doin' wrong
Word out shockin' all alone
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands

You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from a dusty hole
Tales of what somebody told

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad , too bad

Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
Right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

(Rap: Shaquille O'Neal)

Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ is on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realizm
It's the man of steel organizm
Twizm
Not from the prizm, take charge like manilla
Nine five shaq represent with the Thrilla
Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad
Who are you

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it 
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All thru the night I'll save you from the terrors on the screen,
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller,
Thriller here tonight

Darkness falls across the land
The midnite hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
(Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo) 
Uh oh, she's just your type right
Trying to figure out how you could play her
Made you brought up in her life right
Cuz shorty got a mind side
And every time you see her walk by
Stop thinking bout your night life
She all that's in your eyesight
And ever since the first day you seen her thinking she the white type
You figure she'll be perfect loving you
Fantasize a single from her fingers rubbing you
Trying to analyze the situation
You feeling crazy
Wonderin forever what's so special bout this lady
Feeling like you wanna pull back
But you know you perfect for her you got all of what them fools lack
Maybe you should make this thing happen
Brandies and things swinging on the porch while the kids napping
You got everything else you need
Snatch her up fill that empty space she can make your life complete

All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

You like the way you stop the way that she got you hot
Excited said you need what she got
Enticing Mami like the cream of the crop
Pressure getting heavy bout to make your heart pop
All your life you waited for this chick
Nobody told you it'd feel like this
Do anything just to feel that kiss
Wanna give her whatever you got
In front of millions making on whatever the plot

If you would take my hand, baby I will show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I 
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin' to keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'

You're a vegetable, you're a vegetable

What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain...
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?
Aaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaah

What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son...
What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?

Aaaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaah

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Aaaaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaaaaah

We've turned kingdoms to dust

She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane

Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)

She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
And Susie says its right

She got your number
How does it feel
To know this stranger
Is out to kill

She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only
Erase the past

Every night stance is like takin a chances
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)

It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
You know Susie says its right

Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
She put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
Susie says its right

It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)

And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
Ooo... 
When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all getting loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove, and let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules it's up to you (ain't no rules it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night (all right)

Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Want to see an exhibition
Better do it now before you get too old
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy ourselves/yourself
C'mon and groove (yeah) let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy ourselves/yourself
C'mon and groove (yeah) let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Oh no...
Oh no...
Oh
no...

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was to blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying that's ok
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff the you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, na
H
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be!

Oh no...
Oh no...
Oh no...

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the
curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's says that's ok
Hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If
You make me a star

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana...
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana...
Diana!
Diana!
Dirty Diana!
It's Dia...aa...aa...ana!

She said I have to go home
'Cause I'me real tired you see
But I hate sleppin' alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to
Say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me,
She said I'm all yours
tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin' baby I'm alright
I said but unlock the door.
Because I forgot the key.
She said he's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana...
Cause I run UPT!
Cause I run UPT!
Cause I run UPT!
Cause I run UPT! 
Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introducing
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.

You're fearing me, `cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed
I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's `cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I know just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me


The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in tow places at the same time
This is judgement night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear.


What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.
It isn't. It's the beginning. 
(Michael)
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

(Paul)
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your sill dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)

But I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)

So come and go with me
Two on the town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time

I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

The girl is mine, (yep) she's mine
The girl is mine, (yes) she's mine

Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay

Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter

I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover,
You know, don't you remember

Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another

Is that what she said

Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming

I don't believe it

The girl is mine, (mine, mine, mine)
Every Night She Walks Right In My Dreams
Since I Met Her From The Start
I'm So Proud I Am The Only One
Who Is Special In Her Heart

The Girl Is Mine
The Doggone Girl Is Mine
I Know She's Mine
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine

I Don't Understand The Way You Think
Saying That She's Yours Not Mine
Sending Roses And Your Silly Dreams
Really Just A Waste Of Time

Because She's Mine
The Doggone Girl Is Mine
Don't Waste Your Time
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine

I Love You More Than He
(Take You Anywhere)

But I Love You Endlessly
(Loving We Will Share)

So Come And Go With Me
To One Town

But We Both Cannot Have Her
So It's One Or The Other
And One Day You'll Discover
That She's My Girl Forever And Ever

I Don't Build Your Hopes To Be Let Down
'Cause I Really Feel It's Time

I Know She'll Tell You I'm The One For Her
'Cause She Said I Blow Her Mind
The Girl Is Mine
The Doggone Girl Is Mine
Don't Waste Your Time
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine

She's Mine, She's Mine
No, No, No, She's Mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine

The Girl Is Mine, (Yep) She's Mine
The Girl Is Mine, (Yep) She's Mine

Don't Waste Your Time
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine

Michael, We're Not Going To Fight About This, Okay

Paul, I Think I Told You, I'm A Lover Not A Fighter

I've Heard It All Before, Michael, She Told Me That I'm Her Forever Lover, You Know, Don't You Remember

Well, After Loving Me, She Said She Couldn't Love Another

Is That What She Said

Yes, She Said It, You Keep Dreaming

I Don't Believe It

The Girl Is Mine (Mine, Mine, Mine)

Do you remember
When we fell in love
We were so young
And innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began
It just seemed like heaven
So why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall
We'd be together
All day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands
In each other's eyes
We'd stare
(Tell me)

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk
(Ya know)
We'd stay on the phone
At night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so
I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times
They'll jst go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

When we fell in love

After dark...do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
Do you, do you, do you, do you

Yeah yeah 
Stone shaker is looking fine
She's a heart-breaker every time
She never seems to realize
That someday she'll be crying too. Oo!

(She is) A sharp shooter that's moving fast
A slight cruiser loaded with gas
Slowing down to make a pass
You think it's gonna hit you,
So why not take a chance?

'Cause this is Hot Street (Burnin' It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah. (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
on Hot Street - Oo!

A street walker when there's time to spare
Big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares. (No one seems to care)
Within their eyes

Some young lovers are laughing loud
And there's some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round (Spins around and round)
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark

'Cause this is Hot Street (Burnin' It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah. (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
on Hot Street - Oo!

(All night mover) Just trying to put a little fun in their lives
(Winners, losers) You see them standing on the corner in the neon light - Aow!
(Tonight) Oo! Yeah, yeah - Oo!

Some feeling you can't explain
It's such a hard feeling lying in bed's flame
The evening starts to fall again (Starts to fall again)
It's time to come alive
So why not take a chance?

'Cause this is Hot Street (Burnin' It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah. (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
on Hot Street - Oo!
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burnin' It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah. (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
on Hot Street - Oo!

(Fun on the run)
(Ready or not)
(The fantasy will never stop) 
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And create one family oh...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around

Skinhead, deadhead, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dogfood, everybodys gone mad

Refrain:
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody do me - kick me, bite me
Don't you black or white me

Tell me what has become of my life
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I’m tired of bein’ the victim of hate
You're rapin; me of my pride, oh for God's sake
I look to heaven
To fulfill it's prophecy
Set me free

Skinhead, deadhead, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dogfood
Black man, blackmail
Throw the brother in jail

Tell me what has become of my rights
Am I invisible `cause you ignore me?
Your proctamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of bein' the victim of shame
They're throwin' me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no no
Skinhead, deadhead, everybody's gone mad
Situation, speculation, everybody litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin' he wouldn't let this be
Shinhead, deadhead, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dogfood
Kick me, bite me
Don't you wrong or right me

I'm headed for the border
It's on my min
D
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on my back

They say I'm different
They don't understand
But there's a bigger problem
That's much more in demand
You got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me

You got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach
You got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah but there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure
So tell me

Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Stop trippin'

We've got more problems
Than we'll ever need
You got gang violence
And bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people
With no food to eat
Wtih no clothes on their back
And no shoes for their feet

We've got drug addiction
In the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption
Police brutality
We've got streetwalkers
Walkin' into darkness
Tell me
What are you doing
To try to stop this

Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me
Stop trippin'
Yeah stop tripin'
Everybody just stop tripin'

Why you wanna trip on me
Why you wanna trip on me

Ooh My Honey
You Got Me Workin' Day And Night
Ooh My Sugar
You Got Me Workin' Day And Night

Scratch My Shoulder
It's Aching, Make It Feel Alright
When This Is Over
Lovin' You Will Be So Right

I Often Wonder If Lovin' You
Will Be Tonight
But What Is Love Girl
If I'm Always Out Of Sight (Ooh)

(That's Why)
You Got Me Workin' Day And Night
And I'll Be Workin'
From Sun Up To Midnight

You Got Me Workin' Workin' Day And Night
You Got Me Workin' Workin' Day And Night
You Got Me Workin' Workin' Day And Night
You Got Me Workin' Workin' Day And Night

You Say That Workin'
Is What A Man's Supposed To Do
But I Say It Ain't Right
If I Can't Give Sweet Love To You
(Ah)

I'm Tired Of Thinkin'
Of What My Life's Supposed To Be (Well)
Soon Enough Darlin'
This Love Will Be Reality (Ah Ah)

Some Other Guy Instead Of Me (Ooh)

(Hoo, Hoo, Hoo)

You Say That Workin' Is What A Man's Supposed To Do
But I Say It Ain't Right If I Can't Give Sweet Love To You (Well, Ah)

This time around I never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're makin' me sick
Though you really wanna get me
Somebody's out somebody's out to get me
You really wanna fix me hit me
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna get me you really wanna get me


He really thought
He really had a hold of me
He really thought
(he really thought)
They thought they really had control of me


This time around I'm not gon' get bit
Though you really wanna get me
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna fix me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really want to use me and falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me



Listen I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras taps on my phone
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin'
Maybe it could be my friends
But they ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me from making a profit see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-tottin'
If I was dead broke and smoking I'd probobly be by my lonesome
I'm a kill a nigga I ain't jokin'
Endo smoke got me chokin'
I'm hopin' a fool come slippin' so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rocks got pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that baby

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain's scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl when the goin' gets mean

Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now

It's black, it's white
It's tough for them to get by
It's black, it's white, whoo 
Speculate to break
The one you hate
Circulate the lie
You confiscate
Assassinate and
Mutilate
The hounding media
In hysteria
Who's teh next for
You to resurrect
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the
Grassy knoll
The blackmail story
In all your glory

It's Slander
You say it's not
A sword
But with your pen
Your torture men
You'd crucify the lord
Ynd you don't have
To read it, and you
Don't hve to eat it
To buy it is to feed it
So why do we keep
Foolin'oursleves

Just because you
Read it in a magazine
Or see it on a TV screen
Don't make it factual

Though everybody
Wants to read all
About it,
Just because you
Read it in a magazine
Or see it on a TV screen
Don't make it factual
Actual, they say he's
Homosexual

In the hood, frame him
If you could, shoot to
Kill to blame him if you
Will

If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteous-
Ness in the black
Stab me in the back

In the face
To lie and shame the
Race, heroin & merilyn
The hedline stories of
All the glory

It's Slander
You say it's not
A sword
You're a parasite in
The black and white
Do anything for news
If you don't go and
Buy it, Then they
Won't glorify it
To read it sanctifies it
Then why do we keep
Foolin'oursleves

Just because you
Read it in a magazine
Or see it on a TV screen
Don't make it factual
Every body wants to
Read all about it
Just because you
Read it in a magazine
Or see it on a TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody
Wants to believe all
About it

Just because you
Read it in a magazine
Or see it on a TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody
Wants to believe all 
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel

When you're alone
And you're cold inside

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Like stranger in Moscow
Like stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like stranger in Moscow
I'm live in lonely
I'm live in lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

'Why have you come from the West?
Confess! To steal the great achievments of
The people, the accomplishments of the workers...' 
Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid

Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart soft and blue
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.

In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood
Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous colour, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now

Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart gentle and blue
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you. 
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

You always know just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me
Give in to me

It's all right
But it's ok
But it's ok
You're always thinkin'
That you know it's a lie
But it's ok
And I'd
I'd never find
Better peace of mind
No

Don't try to tell me
Because your words
Just aren't enough
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher

Talk to me woman
Love is a
I don't want to hear it
Quench my desire
I'm on fire
Give it to me woman
I don't want to hear it
Tell it to the preacher

Love is a woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me

Love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me

Give it to me woman
Talk to me lady
'Cause I'm on fire 
 I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I cant seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me


Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed to do for you my baby


Another day is gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell you why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did I slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone
Alone, alone, why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did I slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come running, darling
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone 
They Say I'm Different
They Don't Understand
But There's A Bigger Problem
That's Much More In Demand
You Got World Hunger
Not Enough To Eat
So There's Really No Time
To Be Trippin' On Me

You Got School Teachers
Who Don't Wanna Teach
You Got Grown People
Who Can't Write Or Read
You Got Strange Diseases
Ah But There's No Cure
You Got Many Doctors
That Aren't So Sure
So Tell Me

Why You Wanna Trip On Me
Why You Wanna Trip On Me
Stop Trippin'

We've Got More Problems
Than We'll Ever Need
You Got Gang Violence
And Bloodshed On The Street
You Got Homeless People
With No Food To Eat
With No Clothes On Their Back
And No Shoes For Their Feet

We've Got Drug Addiction
In The Minds Of The Weak
We've Got So Much Corruption
Police Brutality
We've Got Streetwalkers
Walkin' Into Darkness
Tell Me
What Are We Doin'

To Try To Stop This

Why You Wanna Trip On Me
Why You Wanna Trip On Me
Why You Wanna Trip On Me
Why You Wanna Trip On Me
Ooh Stop Trippin'
Yeah Stop Trippin'
Everybody Just Stop Trippin'

Why You Wanna Trip On Me

(I love you too I want you
too my love)

Liberian girl...
You came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl...
You came and you change me girl
A feeling so true

Liberi
An girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world,
Just like in the movies,
With two lovers in a scene
And she says...
'Do you love me'
And he says so endlessly...
'I love you, Liberian girl'

(I love you too I want you
to my love)

Liberian girl...
More precious than any pearl
Your love so complete
Liberian girl...
You kiss me then,
Ooh, the world
You do this to me

Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world,
Just like in the movies,
With two lovers in a scene
And she says,
'Do you love me'
And he says so endlessly
'I love you, Liberian girl'

(I love you tooI want you
too my love)

Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world,
I wait for the day,
When you have to say
'I do,'
And I'll smile and say it too,
And forever we'll be true
I love you, Liberian girl, all the time

(Girl)
I love you Liberian girl, all the time
(Girl)
I l
Ove you Liberian girl, all the time
(Girl)
I love you Liberian girl, all the time
(Girl)
I love you
I love you baby
(Girl)
I want you
I love you baby
(Girl)
Oh! I love you baby, I want
you baby, ooh!
(Girl) 

Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you hold me
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Hold me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)

(Carry)
(Carry me boldly)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me there)

(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me)
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there)

(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly)
(Show me you care)

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Need me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence
In my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart 
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know hat I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no


Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no


Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh


Just leave us alone, leave us alone
Please leave us alone 
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
SpeechlessYour love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, 'I love you.' 
Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, makin' love all the way through another night
I remember you and I walking though the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go

Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I'll never let you go, come here girl
Just got to make sweet love `til the break of dawn

I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you
I won't stop `til break of dawn makin' love

Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you've got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There's imagination workin', never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you've never know

Break of dawn, there's no sun up in the sky
Break of dawn, I can see it in your eyes
Break of dawn, girl you got to understand
It's the way that I love you, let me show you I'm your man
Break of dawn


Let's not wait, the sun is out, let's get up and let's get out
It's the day, a brand new day, let's both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, makin' love `til it's dark
Can you move, can you soothe, `til the break of dawn and you know it's true, oh
Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right thriough her
She's a heartbreaker

She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
Ans she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same


I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
And start being without you
But I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you
And stop talkin' aboout you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away


He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they're doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, 'It's you that makes me happy,'
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
and its time to lend a hand to life
There greatest gift of all

We cant go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of Gods great big family
And the truth, you know,
Love is all we need

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
Theres a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
its true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
Theres a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
its true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe theres no way we can fall
Let us realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
Theres a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
its true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Welcome to Hollywood
That's what they told you
A child star in Hollywood
That's what they sold you
Grace with beauty, charm and talent
You would do what you were told
But they robbed you of childhood
Took your youth and sold it for gold

Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star to me

Lovely Elizabeth
You have surpassed them all
My friend Elizabeth
Learned to outlast them all
Many started back when you did
Lost their way and now they're gone
But look at you, a true survivor
Full of life and carrying on

This is your life
You seem to have it all
You reached your peak
They wanted you to fall
It's very sad, this world can be so bad
But though all the heartaches
When they put you down
You know you were the victor
And you earned the crown
It's like walking through the fire
Determined to win
You were beating life's battles
Again and again

Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true

Remember the time I was alone
You stood by my side and said:
'Let's be strong'
You did all these things
That only a true friend can do

Elizabeth, I love you
The world knows your work now
I pray one day I'll be just like... you. 
Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Kinda disgusted
So what does it mean
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks

Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream

Make you wanna scream

Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme

You try to cope with every lie they scrutinise

Somebody please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make you just wanna scream

Tired of you tellin' the story your way
You're causin' confusion
You think it's okay

Keep changin' the rules
While you're playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream

Make you wanna scream

Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme

You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
(Thriller)
(Thriller night)
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you 
No sense pretending its over
Hard times just don't go away
You gotta take that chip off your shoulder
It's time you open up
Have some faith

Nothing good ever comes easy
All good things come in due time
Yes it does
You gotta have something to believe in
I'm telling you to open mind

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
Gotta put it all on the line

You see yourself in the mirror
And you don't like what you see
And things aren't getting much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change

Don't waste your time on the past, no, no
It's time you look to the future
It's all right there if you ask
This time if you try much harder
You'll be the best that could can be

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right

If you wanna do it now
You gotta learn to try
You can make it right somehow
Let love come free
And that's just so easy now
You gotta go for what you want
You gotta do what you got to do

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right

Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever, temperatures risin' now
Power (ah power) is the force the vow

So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complanin' (no no) 
Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd know by now
When and how I get down
And with all that I've been through,
I'm still around

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

Now you can't stop me even thought you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughin', while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby


You can try to stop me, but it wont do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'm a still remain the same,I'm unbreakable


There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady our love will shine
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise
You're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

So listen to my heart
Lay your body next to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you'll always be the lady in my life

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in the beat of ecstasy
Come to me

And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you'll always be the lady in my life

Fill you with the sweetest love
I wanna touch you baby
You're my lady and I love you girl 
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You got to feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away

Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon...

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair...

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there...

She knew no one cared...

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live... 
All you got to do is just walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile, when I try to say hello, to you, yeah
And all you got to do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight,
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

All I got to say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near to me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen,
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true,
Oh baby you give me butterflies

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight,
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight,
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss 
Farewell my summer love

Oh.
I found my happiest days when you came to see your grandma in May.
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good.
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time.

Time's moving too fast for us.

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there... 
Looking In My Mirror
Took Me By Surprise
I Can't Help But See You
Running Often Through My Mind

Helpless Like A Baby
Sensual Disguise
I Can't Help But Love You
It's Getting Better All The Time

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No

Love To Run My Fingers
Softly While You Sigh
Love Came And Possessed You
Bringing Sparkles To Your Eyes

Like A Trip To Heaven
Heaven Is The Prize
And I'm So Glad I Found You Girl
You're An Angel In Disguise

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No

And I'm So Glad I Found You Girl
You're An Angel In Disguise

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

I like lovin' this way
I like lovin' this way

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way 
They wanna get my ass
Dead or alive
You know he really tried to take me
Down by surprise
I bet he missioned with the CIA
He don't do half what he say
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

He out shock in every single way
He'll stop at nothing just to get his political say
He think he hot cause he's BSTA
I bet he never had a social life anyway

You think he brother with the KKK?
I bet his mother never taught him
Right anyway
He want your vote just to remain TA.
He don't do half what he say

Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Dom S.Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Does he send letters to the FBI?
Did he say to either do it or die?

Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Dom S.Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Dom S.Sheldon is a cold man

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart...
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me...

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things...
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the Childhood
I've never known...

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne...

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my Childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the Childhood I've never known...

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...

Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had

The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my Childhood.... 
Don't walk away
See I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you'll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray

And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there's nothing left to do but walk away

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long now all I do is cry
Can't we find some love to take this away
`Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again
How am I to understand
When there's nothing left to du but walk away

See now why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we're going
Everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't wanna walk away
Now why
All my dreams are broken
Don't know where we're going
Everything begins to set us free
Can't you see, I don't wanna walk away

If you go, I won't forget you girl
Can't you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There' nothing left to do
Don't walk away 
We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

Home with their fathers,
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

So pray for all the lost children
Let's pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home 
Ain't the pictures enough, why do you go through so much
To get the story you need, so you can bury me
You've got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose the man I really am

You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be
`cause you cameras can't control, the minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get a story sold

I need my privacy, I need my privacy
So paparazzi, get away from me

Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die
To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away

Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed
Please tell my why
No there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity


Now there's a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

You're Not Like Anybody I Ever Knew
But That Don't Mean That I Don't Know Where We Are
And Though I Find Myself Attracted To You
This Time I'm Trying Not To Go Too Far, Cause

No Matter How It Starts It Ends The Same
Someone's Always Doing Someone More
Trading In The Passion For That Taste Of Pain
It's Only Gonna Happen Again

It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
All Night... All Night

And Though I'm Trying Not To Look In Your Eyes
Each Time I Do They Kind Of Burn Right Through Me
Don't Want To Lay Down In A Bed Full Of Lies
And Yet My Heart Is Saying Come And Do Me

Now We're Just A Web Of Mystery
A Possibility Of More To Come
I'd Rather Leave The Fantasy Of What Might Be
But Here I Go Falling Again 
Never can say goodbye
No no no no, I
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no...

Tell me why
Is it so

That I
Never can say goodbye
No no no no, I
Never can say goodbye

Everytime I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That ?itches me right to the core
It says it's time to run
You know you'll love her more and more

Tell me why
Is it so
Don't wanna let yo go



I keep thinkin that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling and there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old did ya hang up
You carry with you all the time

Tell me why
Is it so
Don't wanna let you go


After you go
I can catch up on my reading
After you go
I'll have a lot more time for sleeping

And when you're gone it looks like things
Are gonna be a lot easier
Life will be a breeze, you know
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue
Sadder than sad
You're the only light
This empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

After you go
I'll have a lot more room in my closet
After you go
I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it

And when you're gone
I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue
Sadder than sad
You're the only light
This empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

I don't have to miss no TV shows
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder, and I'm ...

Bluer than blue
Sadder than sad 
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...
If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...

If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile...

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile 
Got to be there
(Got to be there)
Be there... in the morning
When she says 'hello' to the world

Got to be there
(Got to be there)
Got to... be there,
Bring her good time
And show her that's she's my girl

Oooh... what a feeling I'll be
(...What a feeling I'll be)
The moments I know she loves me...
Cause when I look in her eyes,
I realize...
I need her sharing the world beside... me

So I've got to be there
(Got to be there)
Be there... in the morning
And welcome to my world

And show her that she's my girl
When she says 'hello'.... world
(Got to be there)
I need her sharing the world beside... me

That's why I've... got to be there
(Got to be there)
Got to... be there
When love begins
And that's everywhere she goes

I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me, she's home... 
Here come ol' flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He's got Joo Joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
He wear no shoeshine
He's got toe jam football
He's got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say 'I know you, you know me'
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together right now over me

He bag production
He's got walrus gum-boot
He's got Ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down through his knees
Hold you in his armchair
You can feel his disease

Come together right now over me

He roller coaster
He's got early warning
He's got muddy water
He one Mojo filter
He say 'One and one and one is three'
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see

Come together right now over me 
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere (anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

I used to say 'I' and 'me'
Now it's 'us', now it's 'we'
(I used to say 'I' and 'me'
Now it's 'us', now it's 'we')

Ben, most people would turn you away
(Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say
(A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben 
One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around you

One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day...

One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting for the love we used to share
Just call my name
And I'll be there

You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day...

One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For the love we used to share
Just call my name
And I'll be there 
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late and

She's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
I kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life 
Consciousness expresses itself through creation. this world we live in is the
Dance of the creator. dancers come and go in the twinkling of an eye but the
Dance lives on. On many an occasion when I am dancing, I have felt touched by
Something scared. In those moments, I felt my spirit soar and become one with
Everything that exists.

I become the stars and the moon, I become the lover and the beloved. I become
The victor and the vanquished. I become the master and the slave. I become the
Singer and the song. I become the knower and the known. I keep on dancing then
It is the eternal Dance of creation. The creator and creation merge into one
Wholeness of joy. I keep on dancing...and dancing...and dancing, Until there is
Only...The dance 
She got the look
She so fine
And you know damn well
The girl will be mine

She got the breaks
She the scene
And you know damn well
She gives it to me

Black jeans and
A turtleneck sweater
I know the girl
Is fakin' 'cause
I've seen her look better

She composition
She statistical fact
She got it ready
For the willing
Got it sweaty in the back

Come to the place
Shock tacy
And you know damn well
You know what I mean
Talk hot in the fact
One and 3.
Lik a pleasure trip
Like you've never seen
Satin lace
And a paisley cut top
The girl is waisting over
And she knows
What she's got

She got position
She got just what it takes
She got a mojo
In her pocket
She got it ready
Just in case 
There's A Steam Beat
And It's Comin' After You
You Can Take It
If You Only Let Your Feelings Through

Once all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now it's clear
You took away the fear
You brought me back to life

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life

Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
`Cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm a better man
You taught me by sharing your live


You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong 
I took my baby
On a saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle
Has happened tonight

But, if
You're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or white

They print my message
In the saturday sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
An it's true
Either you're wrong
Or you're right

But, if
You're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the
Going gets rough
I ain't scared of 
They wanna get my ass
Dead or alive
You know he really tried to take me
Down by surprise
I bet he missioned with the CIA
He don't do half what he say

Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

He out shock in every single way
He'll stop at nothing just to get his political say
He think he bad cause he's BSTA
I bet he never had a social life anyway

You think he brother with the KKK?
I know his mother never taught him
Right anyway
He want your vote just to remain TA
He don't do half what he say

Dom Sheldon is a cold man
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
Gone too soon 
We're takin' over
We have the truth
This is the mission
To see it through
Don't point your finger
Not dangerous
This is our planet
You're one of us

We're sendin' out
A major love
And this is our
Message to you
(Message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line
Waitin' for you
Can't you see...?
You're just another part of me...
