I'm coming home and I don't want to hear another word about this
It's hard to fight well and come alone back from the abyss
No more of them lunatic thoughts time's up for the Don Quixote
All I ever wanted was to give this my best shot
The sad part is that you come from a different kind of life
I'm up and leaving now I'm living by the knife
I've lost my faith in human kind and it's time for a rest
Even though I did my best I didn't pass your test
You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray
I need a miracle how to make you understand
I'd make you happy but you're far away

You don't know what you're missing what it is you leave behind
My good intentions for you makes me one of a kind
You'll get by in your fortress you will hide behind that wall
But one day you will find out you almost had it all
The sad part is that you come from a different kind of life
I'm up and leaving now I'm living by the knife
I've lost my faith in human kind and it's time for a rest
Even though I did my best I didn't pass your test
You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray (I want to be with you)
I need a miracle how to make you understand
I'd make you happy but you're far away (far away)
You're princess and I'm just a man
Now I need a miracle to make you understand
The princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
Will I ever make a princess to be my dengadeng, come
You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray (I want to be with you)
I need a miracle how to make you understand
I'd make you happy but you're far away (far away)
You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray (I want to be with you)
I need a miracle how to make you understand
I'd make you happy but you're far away (far away)
You are the princess of Egypt
 
we've come a long way
it's been a rough ride
tell me why all the good things has to come to an end
we've left no stone unturned
tell me what
how will I miss you already waiting for your return

So time has come to leave
let's leave for the reckoning done and let's go
this is the end of the road
we've come a long way
it's been a rough ride
tell me why all the good things has to come to an end
 
I've been hiding, forgotten
I almost got away
but now it's all coming back
and it's time for me to stay
I've seen it all pass me by
in my hibernating state
now I am here once again
and it's time to meet my fate

When I'm on my own
(coming up, coming up)
you're still there
When I'm all alone
(coming up, coming up)
always there

When I close my eyes
takes me back to the start
where it all seemed so right
now we've drifted apart
when I close my eyes
then we're back at the start
where it all seemed so right
how come you're still in my heart

This is the perfect moment
I'm on to something good
there is no fear
I will always know I did what I could
if something stands in my way
then I will break down the door
so please don't stand in my way
'cause then it's a full-out war

When I'm on my own
(coming up, coming up)
you're still there
When I'm all alone
(coming up, coming up)
always there

When I close my eyes
takes me back to the start
where it all seemed so right
now we've drifted apart
when I close my eyes
then we're back at the start
where it all seemed so right
how come you're still in my heart

When I close my eyes
you are on your way tonight
you come all of the way 
to my heart

I've been hiding, forgotten
I almost got away
but now it's all coming back
and it's time for me to stay
I've seen it all pass me by
in my hibernating state
now I am here once again
and it's time to meet my fate

when I close my eyes
then we're back at the start
where it all seems so right
how come you're still in my heart

When I close my eyes
takes me back to the start
where it all seemed so right
now we've drifted apart
when I close my eyes
then we're back at the start
where it all seemed so right
how come you're still in my heart

Yeah hey
Come follow me
I've got all systems go nothing standing in my way
I should be far down the road but I'm not
Something's holding me back like a wild boar attack
and I've got you by my side but your not
Do you remember when
we thought there was no end
a shooting star around the sky
Do you remember when
you were from heaven sent
how far the wind could make me fly
Angles crying, when you're far away from me
Always trying, I will make you see
Angles crying (the angles cry), when you're far away from me
No denying (there's no deny), we were meant to be
I tumbled from the sky
where I was soaring so high
never thought that I could fall back down to the ground
Somewhere along the ride
I found that we can't stop the tide
it's time for me to buy another round
Do you remember when

I will follow the road 
down to Africa
If that's what it takes
just want you to know

I can't stop myself
'cause it all went to my head and out
it's falling apart
takes my breath away
I just need another day or two
I'm back at the start

Wherever I might go tonight
why go away, when you won't last for a day
but I know I will be alright
whatever if I can't make you stay

I will follow the road 
down to Africa
I just wanna see
if it's really you and me
I will follow the road 
down to Africa
if that's what it takes
just want you to know

Round and round we go
time has come to make a choice
is this how I wanna live
still don't know what's on
when I walk up to the edge
I must learn how to forgive

Wherever I might go tonight

but I know I will be alright
whatever if I can't make you stay

I've crossed the river, and I mean to go far
I'm heading out on the ocean, alone, invisible
I know, in my mind, where I go, I wanna see it all
While I can, here I come, hear me say
Once in a lifetime
Follow the moonshine
Once in a lifetime
Come with me
I'm flying, high up in the sky
Where it all makes sense
I'm flying, you're the reason why
I am here now
I'm flying, high up in the sky
Where it all makes sense
I'm flying, you're the reason why
I'm here
I'm juggernaut, I'm blinded by the sun, this is it
Far away, there is no second chance
I'm on my way, all aboard for the ride
I am already here so you can't leave me behind hear me say
Once in a lifetime
Follow the moonshine
Once in a lifetime
Come with me
I'm flying, high up in the sky
Where it all makes sense
I'm flying, you're the reason why
I am here now
I'm flying, high up in the sky
Where it all makes sense

That was the day 
when I first saw the light
I know that I should have 
put up for a fight
Not since the day 
have I looked in the eyes
where you could see 
the arabian skies

how can it be
that the desert provide
something so precious
you'd think that I lied
wherever you are
I'll remember you still
Il el el el el bitti a kill

I saw the Arabian star
falling from the sky
I wish that we can do it all again
I saw the Arabian star
still I wonder where
you are

Being on this journey
for so many years
thought that I've seen it all
faced all my fears
nothing prepared me 
for what I've been through
all is compared
with the memories of you

how can it be
that the desert provide
something so special
you'd think that I lied
wherever you are
I'll remember the thrill
Il el el el el bitti a kill

I saw the Arabian star
falling from the sky
I wish that we can do it all again
I saw the Arabian star
still I wonder where
you are

how can it be
that the desert provide
something so precious
you'd think that I lied
wherever you are
I'll remember you still
Il el el el el bitti akill

I saw the Arabian star
I wish that we can do it all again
I saw the Arabian star
still I wonder where
you are

I saw the Arabian star
falling from the sky
I wish that we can do it all again
I saw the Arabian star
still I wonder where
you are

I saw the Arabian star
falling from the sky
I wish that we can do it all again
I saw the Arabian star
still I wonder where
you are
 
One more time 
I saddle up and leave for no mans land
like so many times before
they say that lightning strikes not once but twice 
and I ain't gonna stay
cause I can't take anymore

When memories make themselves heard
go away - go away
you know that you gave me your word
gonna go on my own

Time, time take me where
I'm no longer a stranger
I'll do anything
I know I'll find a way
Time, time take me there
and with the speed of lightning
I'll do anything
I know I'll find a way

Now I know
here's where the story ends and I have come
to the point of no return
and when I'm looking back at the times 
where it all began
I know that I still have much to learn

When memories make themselves heard
go away - go away
you know that you gave me your word
gonna go on my own

Time, time take me where
I'm no longer a stranger
I'll do anything
I know I'll find a way
Time, time take me there
and with the speed of lightning
I'll do anything
I know I'll find a way

Gonna go on my own
Cause I can't take anymore
ain't gonna stay
ain't gonna stay

Time, time will take me there
I will go anywhere
I know you'll run along
cause I can't take anymore
ain't gonna stay

Time, time take me where
I'm no longer a stranger
I'll do anything
I know I'll find a way
Time, time take me there
and with the speed of lightning
I'll do anything
I know I'll find a way
 
Well, I am for real but I am on my way
Silent, of course, but I won't be late
Greed, don't you worry, never let it gonna stay
beat it my loneliness - Go!
so stir it up whatever you don't have to change style
no more trauma, was so far away, you'll only make it die
come back again, always a friend
is that the message I'd like to send?

 I want you to feel no more loneliness
so ring the alarm
you open my mind
now I talk to the sign
you clear up the sight
now I'm up for the night

Time is for real something you'll never change
all that you gotta do, of course, you're acting strange
Rise again, set again, it's all within your range
Do what you gotta do ' Go!
So don't come tell me things that you don't understand
When it's all about the honesty and time for you to learn
come back again, you're always a friend
is that the message I'd like to send?

 I want you to feel no more loneliness
so ring the alarm
you open my mind
now I talk to the sign
you clear up the sight
now I'm up for the night 

(When) I know I'm supposed to be right
(but) I know that you can't stop the flow
(and) You know I'm here
gonna be 
What you are but not what you see

I want you to feel no more loneliness
I want you to feel no more loneliness
so ring the alarm

 I want you to feel no more loneliness
so ring the alarm
you open my mind
now I talk to the sign
you clear up the sight
now I'm up for the night  
You will always be the one for me
even though I tried my best to hide it
when love was coming to an end
for everything I've failed to be
it's time for me to make you understand
You tell me that it's over
but I have to let you know
I'll always be around close to you
'until the end of time
I'll be true
there won't be any doubt that I'll be here
my ship will always sail somewhere near
I'll see you when the seas are rolling in
I remember how it used to be
every day and every night together
It's hard to leave it all behind
there's so much more for you and me
if only I could make you change your mind
You tell me that it's over
but I have to let you know
I'll always be around close to you
'until the end of time
I'll be true
there won't be any doubt that I'll be here
my ship will always sail somewhere near
I'll see you when the seas are rolling in
I believe
there's a chance in a better tomorrow
that's why I want you to know
I'll always be around close to you
'until the end of time
I'll be true
there won't be any doubt that I'll be here
my ship will always sail somewhere near
I'll always be around close to you
'until the end of time
I'll be true
there won't be any doubt that I'll be here
my ship will always sail somewhere near
I'll see you when the seas are rolling in
 
Once there were shadows around me ghosts were howling on the prowl
you know there are things to be done no one around care
So give me all of them, and I will follow them
There won't be no one around to see cause
I'm the Last Man Standing
Brightness falls and then you're gone with the wind
You won't see me again
Darkness calls this is a fight I can't win
I'll leave you in the rain
I'll find a way
Got to move on and I will survive
I'll find a way
No matter what I will stay alive
Now we have searched for the meaning I am set adrift again
Who knows what will come from the mission will still be here
Don't tell me what to do, this is the way you know
There won't be no one around to see cause
I'm the Last Man Standing
Brightness falls and then you're gone with the wind
You won't see me again
Darkness calls this is a fight I can't win
I'll leave you in the rain
I'll find a way
Got to move on and I will survive
I'll find a way
No matter what I will stay alive
Brightness falls and then you're gone with the wind
You won't see me again
Darkness calls this is a fight I can't win
I'll leave you in the rain
I'll find a way
Got to move on and I will survive
I'll find a way
No matter what I will stay alive
I'll find a way
Got to move on and I will survive
I'll find a way
No matter what I will stay alive
 
Come follow me

I've got all systems going nothing standing in my way
I should be far down the road but I'm not
Something's holding me back like a wild boar attack
and I've got you by my side but you're not

Do you remember when we thought there was no end
a shooting star around the sky
Do you remember when you were from heaven sent
how far the wind could make me fly

Angel's crying, when you're far away from me
Always trying, I will make you see
Angel's crying, (the angels cry), when you're far away from me
No denying, (there's no deny), we were meant to be

I tumbled from the sky where I was soaring so high
never thought that I could fall back to the ground
Somewhere along the ride I found that we can't stop the tide
it's time for me to buy another round


Angels are crying

Angels are crying

Angels are crying

Yeah

I've got all systems going nothing standing in my way
I should be far down the road but I'm not
Something's holding me back like a wild boar attack
and I've got you by my side but you're not

Angel's crying, (the angels cry), when you're far away from me
Always trying, (I always try), I will make you see
Angel's crying, (the angels cry), when you're far away from me
No denying, (there's no deny), we were meant to be

When I saw you today how you tried to disguise all the feelings you've
kept inside
Then my world fell apart and I opened my eyes giving up on my foolish
pride
You may say that you've fallen for somebody new
but I guess that you know what to do
Walk away and come with me
don't turn around just walk away and you will see
there's still a chance that you and I can make a new start
if you follow the road to your heart
I've been walking around
with a stone in my shoe since the day when you said goodbye
For the wisdom I've found
I behaved like a fool and I can't find a reason why
Now you say that you've fallen for somebody new
but I guess that you know what to do
Walk away and come with me
don't turn around just walk away and you will see
there's still a chance that you and I can make a new start
if you follow the road to your heart
Walk away with me
and you will see
there's always a chance for us
if you wanna go
Walk away and come with me
don't turn around just walk away and you will see
there's still a chance that you and I can make a new start
if you follow the road to your heart
Walk away and come with me
don't turn around just walk away and you will see
there's still a chance that you and I can make a new start
if you follow the road to your heart
 
I've got all systems go nothing standing in my way
I should be far down the road but I'm not
Something's holding me back like a wild horse attack
And I've got you by my side but your not
Do you remember when
We thought there was no end
A shooting star around the sky
Do you remember when
You were from heaven sent
How far the wind could make me fly
Angles crying
when you're far away from me
Always trying
I will make you see
Angles crying
when you're far away from me
No denying, we were meant to be
I tumbled from the sky where I was soaring so high
I never thought that I could fall back down to the ground
Somewhere along the ride I found that we can't stop the tide
It is time for me to buy another round
Do you remember when
We thought there was no end
A shooting star around the sky
Do you remember when
You were from heaven sent
How far the wind could make me fly
Angles crying
when you're far away from me
Always trying
I will make you see
Angles crying
when you're far away from me
No denying, we were meant to be
Well folks, I've got all systems go
nothing standing in my way
I should be far down the road but I am not
Something's holding me back like a wild horse attack
and I've got you by my side but you're not 
We are forever wild
Come follow me now
Hear how....this bell tolls just for you
Don't fight what this will bring you
This is what to do
We're starting out from low
Time to go insane
Take a step into the fast lane
Rattle all your chains
It's Friday in your veins, believe it

We're going, you know it
Nothing can stop us from now
Too well-bred, a pinhead?
Hate to disappoint you, but
I'm not that kind of guy

We are forever wild
Let's change the night into day
We are forever wild
I've come to take you away
We are forever wild
Get ready now and forever
You know, 'This is the way'

Everybody go PoP up now....

Face it the gathering is here
I know you're out there somewhere
Can you feel the fear
Grow when you get near
You're up against the wall
You must make up your mind now
Can you hear the call
We've got to give it all, believe it

We're going, you know it
Nothing can stop up from now
Too well-bred, a pinhead?
Hate to disappoint you, but
I'm not that kind of guy

We are forever wild
Let's change the night into day
We are forever wild
I've come to take you away
We are forever wild
Get ready now and forever
You know, 'This is the way' 
I'm standing in the face of the storm
where I will learn which way to go
I feel like I am true to form
But still I want to take it slow

I know from the past
where I'm wrong
so let things come in a different way

I am waiting for a star to fall down
need someone around
from time to time
when I'm walking the streets of my hometown
is there someone for me to find

Now time has come to say goodbye
to all the things I couldn't find
wherever I might go tonight
at least I have made up my mind

I know from the past
where I'm wrong
I'll let things come in a different way

I am waiting for a star to fall down
need someone around
from time to time
when I'm walking the streets of my hometown
is there someone for me to find

I know from the past
where I'm wrong
so let things come in a different way

I will be there (I am waiting)
I will be there (for a star to fall down)
someone from time to time
I will be there (when I'm walking the streets)
I will be there (of my hometown)
Is there someone for me to find

I am waiting for a star to fall down
need someone around
from time to time
when I'm walking the streets of my hometown
is there someone for me to find
 
Here I go again it's time
for me to fade away
Here I Go
It's time again to let the
storm rise and I'm waiting
here with great expectations
and I know
You call it what you want
but for now I'm standing tall
and I'm here to get it all
give me your best shot or go
You got to move on
You better believe it
And you'll find out this is
the time of your life
You got to move on
You better believe it
You can be sure this is
the ride of you're life
Here I go again
It's time for me to fade away
I'm out of here I go again
I've lost the game
And no one is to blame
So time waits for no one
and I only get one chance
to be on top of the world
and you know
If you want to move on
you will have to be strong
cause it wont last long
you will reap what you sow
You got to move on
You better believe it
And you'll find out this is
the time of your life
You got to move on
You better believe it
You can be sure this is
the ride of you're life
Here I go again
It's time for me to fade away
I'm out of here I go again
I've lost the game
And no one is to blame
So time is running out I feel
I have to let you go
And I know
No one is to blame 
I'm calling up on your attention, now is the time, we're talking
serious redemption
come follow me, red light wasn't warning when I first saw her body
move, I wasn't sure it was a jet stall
I thought I had it all, now I am down and low, memories on the wall, I
have to let it go.....
I'm free like a flying demon, no more of them filthy lies
Just free like a flying demon, this is the day of my life
Why can't you see into the future, you're going to get hurt by someone
who won't suit you, they call it your destiny, but I am pretty sure
now, the one who is lonely can't get hurt he/she is growing stronger
I thought I had it all, now I am down and low, memories on the wall, I
have to let it go.....
I'm free like a flying demon, no more of them filthy lies
Just free like a flying demon, this is the day of my life
Someday it might just work but this ain't the time
This grounded flight is taking off, I leave you behind
I'm free like...a demon...no more of them filthy lies...just free
like...a demon... this is the day of my life
I'm free like a flying demon, no more of them filthy lies
Just free like a flying demon, this is the day of my life 
No more tears
on my own again
I never say goodbye

Here I am
I feel like a hurricane
but upside down
I move like in M.A.D.
to every sound
trembling before you
cause I'm going down ...

My last stand
is all that I'm hearing 
will I ever find
an answer to what I have 
on my mind
thousand yard stare 
cause I'm going down ...

No more tears
on my own again
I never say goodbye
I will be just fine
You're still on my mind
Will you ever tell me why

Aiming high
I turn from the light
and I am on my way
falling into the darkness
I can't stay
There's no escape
and I am going down

Final try
I'm back from the other side
and right on time
to once and for all claim
back what's mine
the future is bright
and I won't go down

No more tears
on my own again
I never say goodbye
I will be just fine
You're still on my mind
Will you ever tell me why

No more tears
on my own again
I never say goodbye
still on my mind
Will you ever tell me why

No more tears
on my own again
I never say goodbye
I will be just fine
You're still on my mind
Will you ever tell me why

You had to go that far to prove your strength and ability
To stand alone against the tide of tears
It made me see some of my own stupidity
But it's too late to look back at the old fears

So tell me, I'm lost and I'm out here
Tell me, if there is a chance...

I fell like I fall from the sky
I wonder where you are
I never did understand why
You had to go that far....

I feel like I fall from the sky
I wonder where you are
I never did understand why
You had to go

We could have had all we wanted
Do you remember all the things we said
Or have you lost that sense of freedom we hunted
Are all the dreams we had forgotten and dead?

So tell me, I'm lost and I'm out here
Tell me, if there is a chance

I feel like I fall from the sky
I wonder where you are
I never did understand why
You had to go that far....

I feel like I fall from the sky
I wonder where you are
I never did understand why
You had to go

I know that it's far to late
Too many things have been said
But I wonder if you....
Could ever believe in me
Tell me, if there is a chance 
Hold your horses tonight, Lose control for a night
'til the morning comes
So here it comes again
You'll love it when you hear it
Cause we're leaving now
We'll never look back
We're on the move again
Join in or step aside
We go for all time high
And that's what we're gonna reach
We're going loco, time to go insane
All common sense is going down the drain
We're going loco, time to go insane
All common sense is going down the drain
Hold your horses tonight, everybody's here now
Let's go wild for a night, 'til the morning comes
Hold your horses tonight, everybody's here now
Lose control for a night, 'til the morning comes
We're going loco, time to go insane
All common sense is going down the drain
We're going loco, time to go insane
All common sense is going down the drain
Hold your horses tonight, everybody's here now
Let's go wild for a night, 'til the morning comes
Hold your horses tonight, everybody's here now
Lose control for a night, 'til the morning comes 
Campione, campione (etc.)

Here we go!

It's time to get together
We are a dream team
Full steam, all the way across the land
We got ourselves a landslide comin' up
The gathering is here and the reckoning is here
Take a stand!

Well there can be only one

I should be far down the road but I'm not
Something's holding me back like a wild boar attack
and I've got you by my side but you're not
Do you remember when we thought there
was no end a shooting star around the sky
Do you remember when you were from heaven sent
how far the wind could make me fly
Angels crying, when you're far away from me
Always trying, I will make you see
Angels crying, when you're far away from me
No deniying,we were ment to be
I tumbled from the sky where I was soaring so high
never thought that I could fall back to the ground
Somewhere along the ride I found
that we can't stop the tide
it is time for me to buy another round
Do you remember when we thought there was no end
a shooting star around the sky
Do you remember when you were from heaven sent
how far the wind could make me fly
Angels crying,when you're far away from me
Always trying,I will make you see
Angels crying,when you're far away from me
No deniying,we were ment to be 
This... this is the way... this is the way I wanna live
I'm going through changes
This is the way I wanna live
From this day on no one is going to tell me
What I should do or what I should not
That ain't the way, the way it shall be fight it all the way
So let them vultures pray on each other
Don't let them spoil it, you've come this far
Coming out like a force of nature
This is the shape of things to come
This... this is the way... this is the way I wanna live
I'm going through changes
This is the way I wanna live
So if you're feeling sort of down and out
Don't lose your faith, wipe away the doubt
You must take a stand, that's what it is about
If nothing else works just Shout!
You're no baloney Homo Sapien!
You're the original king of the hill again!
Coming out like a force of nature
This is the shape of things to come
This... this is the way... this is the way I wanna live
I'm going through changes
This is the way I wanna live...
 
It's time to cut the slack now,
you are gonna hear me balin' truth
Back out from the underworld I'm here now,
I've got something to prove
So hush and keep up now, serious, I'm telling you that
she's one of a kind
Keep all your fingers to yourself,
I'm here to take back what's mine
Here me say...
REF:
This time you're all mine, Let us shine
I can't get you of my mind, I just wanna be with you
You're the best I'll ever find, I wanna be with you
I'm on a mission from God,
I'm crazy, this war that I will win for sure,
My middle name is overkill,
keep watching, you'll see that I will score
Boom, Boom, when we come across,
the sea what ever we search for we will find
Keep all your fingers to yourself,
I'm here to take back what's mine
Here me say...
REF again
Here me I'm here to take back what's mine
I just wanna be with you
What ever I'll search for I will find
I wanna be with you 
Away,
Astray but on track to what I think 
Will be the best of times when I'm on my own.
So if I may, I'll say yes, I am the player
Always on the move, I'm strong when I'm all alone.

Some things will change -
I can feel it coming but I don't know what it is.
Feel out of range -
Don't know what to do, but I'll live.

It must be like paradise,
If only someone could tell me how
So please start rolling the dice
Cause I can feel that my time is now.
It must be like paradise.

Confused, reduced to a life where I'm no longer in control
All in all I got used to be
I'm not afraid, I played all the cards that I was dealt
But this is new, I'll just have to wait and see.

Some things will change -
Don't know what to do, but I'll live.

It must be like paradise,
If only someone could tell me how
So please start rolling the dice
Cause I can feel that my time is now.
It must be like paradise.

It must be like paradise. 
There is something I have to say to you before
I am on my knees and I am looking for some answers
You've got that certain something, I don't know what to do
Don't tell what is better, I'm just not a fool
Ah, should've never done that
Ah, why did I do that
Ah, will you forgive me
I'm calling, I'm calling your name
Ah, should've never done that
Ah, why did I do that
I'm calling, I'm calling your name
Where the winds would never lie
And I that it can't be the same
Where the winds would never lie
I'm calling, I'm calling your name
I just can't let you go, can't let you get away
I'm such a fool for you and tired of being second to none
I'm gonna take you with me and chase the clouds away
Why can't you see your body's begging me to stay
We are forever lovers
I just can't take anymore
Why don't you call my name
I wonder why I can't let you go
 
I wake to the sound of a far away thunder
Wondering why this secret in your heart
Why don't you let me share your thoughts
Something strange is going on
Maybe something you've gone through
So often sadness in your eyes
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
Do you always have to be alone?
Just by yourself, just you alone
Why don't you let me in?
Do you always have to go away, so far away, so far away?
Why can't you stay?
In a place of refuge where no one's allowed
Somewhere up north where no helping hands will reach you
In your silent desert land
As captain of a peaceful phantom ship
In a proud and senseless soul
How am I supposed to help you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
Do you always have to be alone?
Just by yourself, just you alone
Why don't you let me in?
Do you always have to go away, so far away, so far away?
Why can't you stay?
 
So, i am what i am and what i feel can not be wrong
This is the way that i feel and i'm coming on strong
We're talking hundreds and thousands with potential to stay
But only one with quality can turn the loneliness away

Com folla me, one is a wonder
One is a wonder
But only one is a wonder
One is a wonder
Set the world on a fire
I'll do anything to get what i want
Aim even higher
I'll do anything to be the one
So i'm crusing round the continent to see what i can find
A lot of fangs but i refuse to be a slave to the grind
We're talking gadda-da-vida, honey now the deed is done
And if you're in you've got to show that you really are the one

Com folla me, one is a wonder
One is a wonder
But only one is a wonder
(I'm gonna)
Set the world on a fire
I'll do anything to get what i want
(I'm gonna)
Aim even higher
I'll do anything to be the one 
Let's you and me together leave for higher ground
when you're all alone just listen to the sound
Lullaby,
we fall asleep when we hear...
lullaby,
we fly away when we hear...
lullaby,
we travel far when we hear...
lullaby,
when we hear the Russian lullaby...
in the night, when the seas are rolling in
in the night, when the stars are shining clear
in the night, when the ghosts are howling near
in the night, when we sing the Russian lullaby
When we are going through the night in search of light
let's you and me enjoy the mach 5 speed of life
Lullaby,
we fall asleep when we hear...
lullaby,
we fly away when we hear...
lullaby,
we travel far when we hear...
lullaby,
when we hear the Russian lullaby...
in the night, when the seas are rolling in
in the night, when the stars are shining clear
in the night, when the ghosts are howling near
in the night, when we sing the Russian lullaby

Time has come to get the troops back together
No one's cruising for a bruising
It's a landslide, can't die
Time to get what's coming to me
Time to let things go
There is no way to stop the yellow danger
Time has come for you
Cause I'm back...
Back!Cause I'm back...Back!
I'm back...
Back!Cause I'm back...Back!
Snap out of it now
We're bak in the loop and it's time to move on
We're aiming for all or nothing now
We're back in the loop and it's time to move on
For us it is all or nothing
Who are you? friend or foe?
Now leave your sorrows all behind
This ain't enough, hanging tough
Now you must make up your mind
We can't stay down, we have to leave
There is no place for us to hide so this is it
you've been warned now either join or step side
Cause I'm back...
Back with a vengeance 
Lived my life to the extreme
I've been waisting my time with lies
Lived my life from dream to dream
you have awaken the beast that sleeps
I'll be forever here, around you day and night
I'll never let you down, I'll stay right here...
You know, that I will always stand by your side
You know, that what we've got is stronger than pride
You know, there is nothing I wouldn't do I'll always stay with you
You must give me half a chance
I am not what I used to be
I know, this sudden change
must be confusing for you to see
I'll be forever here, around you day and night
I'll never let yo down, I'll stay right here...
I'll be forever here, around you day and night
I just want you to know where I am
I just want to make sure that you know... 
My mind keeps drifting back
To things we said this morning
Now i'm sitting here alone
Watching the world pass me by
Every time we part i fell like i'm falling
No matter what you think
I still love you

You will always be a part of me
No matter what we do
You will always hold a piece of me
Wherever i may go
Always....

The sky gets darker
And i sense that you are far and away
I miss the times we had when things were going our way
But every time we part you know how much it hurts me
No matter what you think
I still love you.

You will always be a part of me
No matter what we do
You will always hold a piece of me
Wherever i may go
Always.... 
I was blinded by your presence
I was fooled by your beauty
And now I'm falling, falling out of love
You've gone so far away
But in my mind you'll say
I don't know when
But I'm sure
I'm gonna see your face again 
Shakira is shit !!! She sucks e-type's dick!!!!
