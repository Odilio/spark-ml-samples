No way out of your misery
Alone in pain and agony
Lay depressed and hollow
One thought in your mind
-No Tomorrow

And then you had made up your mind
and thought it was your time
You left this world without shedding a tear
without hope, without fear

So you thought you'd just put your head
into the Noose and let it all go... and so you did
Oh yeah, you did

Now you come haunting every night
Calling my name until I...
wake up feeling this sorrow
One thought in my mind
- I will follow

I'll drink the booze to depress myself
then I take the rope and express myself
I'll leave this world without shedding a tear
without hope, without fear

Yeah, I think I'll put my head
into the Noose and let it all go... and so I will
Oh yeah, I will

I'll take the rope, just like you
and wherever you are, I'll be too

I think I'll just put my head
into the Noose and let it all go... and so I will
Oh yeah, I will

Think about all the good in your life it's only temporary
Think about all the positive sides in life
They never last forever

So drink to forget
And drown all your sorrow
Bury your dreams
Choose mind refinery

All the tears and the fears
and the lies and the cries and the...
(Nepenthe)
All the tears and the fears
and the lies and the cries of the past

When the light of the chosen has died
When the Master is slave to his life

All the fears and the tears
and the lies and the cries and the...
(Forget)
All the love and the hate
and the hate and the hate for you - my love

When the light of the chosen has died
It is time to do something right
for once, goddamned!

So drink to forget
And drown all your sorrow
Bury your dreams
And choose Catharsis!

All the tears and the fears
and the lies and the cries and the...
(Revenge)
All the hate in the world is the power
to bring you down!

When the light of the chosen has died
It is time to pay back for their crimes

The candles have been blown out by the wind
don't be scared, my love, I'm right by your side
I still remember the times I walked alone... dead
until you woke me up and made me come alive

With her love she feeds the fire in my heart
And in her eyes, oh the birth of stars

The sun won't shine on me without your love
...don't you know
The cold wind kills the flame in my heart
...by its blow

She gave me everything I had craved
through the years of pain
the years of pain

With her love she feeds the fire in my heart
Oh she's my only light
In the dark

The sun won't shine on me without your love
...don't you know
The cold wind kills the flame in my heart
...by its blow

Dead Calm all around
I know of a heaven...
and damn sure...
I know of a Hell...
if you could take a look into this fighter's mind...
the things you'd see.
What would you think?
How would you feel?
If you could really know me... mmm...
Can you see this Hell I feel inside?
A tragedy in a human mind.

That's what I am!!!
So turn away, turn away and go.
Turn away while you still can.
Turn away.

The way I'm gonna go is not the way you want to go!
This reign that I have built myself,
over the years, will crumble down me.
Life's double edged sword gives both pleasure and pain.
And it's MY cross to be carried!!!
Can you see this chaos-ridden mind?
This tragedy, this tragedy of a human mind.

That's how I am!!!
"It might seem it's just a part of the illusion of life.
There's no perfection in this world,
and in the end we're but two strangers
sailing our personal seas of sorrow..."
I've been to heaven! (and let me tell you)
I have been "down there" So turn away, go.

Turn away while you still can.
Turn away.
The way I'm gonna go is not the way you want to go!
Turn away, Turn away...
This is the way I wanna go

Hey little sister what have you done
Hey little sister who's the only one
Hey little sister who's your superman
Hey little sister who's the one you want
Hey little sister shot gun!

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.

Hey little sister what have you done
Hey little sister who's the only one
I've been away for so long (so long)
I've been away for so long (so long)
I let you go for so long

It's a nice day to start again (come on)
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.

Take me back home
There is nothin' fair in this world
There is nothin' safe in this world
And there's nothin' sure in this world
And there's nothin' pure in this world
Look for something left in this world
Start again
Come on

It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.

Frozen soil... A dim moonlight
I've been... this glorious rid
Raise the arms in victory
I've seen... on this glorious night

I've kept my eyes open wide
Through my dream I was given a hint:
My sky is darker than yours, my star is brighter than yours
A glance to the moonlight shadow reveals the runes of yesterday
I am of Astral Strain, my sky is darker than thine

Die... die... die!
I... I... I... despite
Destroy!

The goals I've set to myself are far beyond mortality
To dominate, desolate everything weak that cannot stand alone

And losers shall drop...
One after one...

I am before all gods
Who art thou to come to me?
You are the great pretender
And you will always be
(so die)

Frozen time... The astral gate
I've been before on this ground
Open wide before my eyes
I see... on this glorious ride

Now I know...
It was written in the stars that I am the Wrathchild
I laugh as you cry

I am the one who laughs as you cry...
I am the one who laughs for last and laughs forever more

The goals I've set to myself are far beyond humanity
To dominate, desolate everything - I'm heading to immortality!

And losers shall drop...
One after one...
I WON!!!

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death.

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below.

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan.

"He shall appear to thee and thou shall know Him.
He is no son of god, He is the son of the Earth!"

A new Messiah...
He's walked among the living
And lived among the dead
He holds the key up there...

Far too long - the truth's been inverted
by false tongues
And far too long - false prophets have infested
the holy ground
The holy Earth;
The pagan Reign of Nature...
The time is right (too late)

Fall from Grace, New Age Messiah
As a lightning cracks the sky
Show the world its final fate
Rise to the heights, New Age Messiah
They will worship you and hail!
As the world goes down the drain
The new Messiah leads the way!

"He shall appear to thee and thou
shall understand.
He shall promise no salvation but let
you see what is imminent"

Chosen by His own will
As written by Himself
A new Messiah
Has come to guide mankind
On its downward trail
He holds the key down there...

Far too long - they had to wait Him to arrive
And far too long - the hordes believed all the lies
Now all can see: the "Hand of Darwin"
rocks this human cradle-grave
God is dead, god is dead, long live the Nature!

Fall from grace, New Age Messiah
On your first and last crusade
Show the world its final fate
Rise to the heights, New Age Messiah
So they can hear Your words of gold
As the world goes down the drain
The new Messiah makes your day
Fall from grace, New Age Messiah
From the dark side of the Moon
To the point of no return -
welcome the Prophet of Doom
Open doors to a new millennium, to a new reality
As the world goes down the drain
A new Messiah walks away

Eyes without light can see so clear
what those with sight are blind to...
The final fight is getting near
And they were right, we will lose...
Come this far no turning back
A kiss before it all turns black
My stars have fallen from the sky
My dreams have faded into the Night
No Tomorrow
not for me
Pain and Sorrow
all I see
All I feel
The final night is getting near...
The fading light - weall be through
For the first time I'm feeling fear
And oh, damn right - we will lose
The shadows growing deep
We'll be gone eternally
Our stars have fallen from the sky
Our dreams have faded into the Night
No Tomorrow
not for us
Death and Sorrow
dust to dust
Dust to Dust

A gathering in the cold, in the North, in the dark lands of Pohjola
Where the sun had not been crossing the sky nor seen for centuries...

We were brought together by oaths we had once sworn - by blood...
...once together drawn...

We had gathered all our forces
Called together all the heroes
Equipped a hundred swordmen
And a thousand men with crossbows

Strengthened by hate and the thirst for the enemies' blood
We lay in wait for the season of no light
We had seen the frozen mist - we weren't afraid to die
And the oath we had sworn gave us reason to live on

A Calm before the Storm
(We were) Awaiting the Winter Frost

...And then a storm arose in fury
The sky was shattered by lightning...

Awaiting the Winter Frost
As the sky blackened and the stars turned red
The frost greeted us with a cold northern breeze

Off with their heads! Off with their fuckin' heads!!!
Oh, the time had come...
To slaughter the hordes of cowardice
And cleanse the North from lies

We had gathered all our forces
Called together all the heroes
Equipped a hundred swordmen
And a thousand men with crossbows

We raised our swords
Grasped the irons
Lifted our bows
And chose the arrows

The false ones' hordes were put to the sword
The strong and the weak, one by one...
Their race was slaughtered to the very last man
Our bloodfeind was done as their bodies reddened the land

Awaiting the Winter Frost
The sign of the dark and the cold
the spell of pure hate

Awaiting the Winter Frost

And the heathen peace was found

Like roses wither so does hope
as we approach our final fate
A new dawn of man?
Oh no, can't you feel, the End is on its way...

It's all over, said and done, haven't you heard?
We are living our last days in this world
Oh, Give Up Hope, do it now
the world is coming Crumbling Down

we have passed
the point of No Return by far
and swept away the last sheds of hope
A new dawn of man?
Oh no, can't you feel, the End is on its way...

It's all over, said and done, haven't you heard?
We are living our last days on this earth
Oh, your days are over!
Your world is finished!

Down down down down
Thy kingdom gone
Down down down down
My kingdom come

This is it
This is the End
Free at last

In the dark... in death
Eyes can't see... I cannot feel
No voices... no light... no existence
A dreamlike void surrounds me

silence... emptiness...
peace of mind... in death

In emptiness...
I focus mt thoughts on my life
In death I have the time to think of the past

Solitude...
won't break my peace of mind
Because here I must dwell eternally

In memoriam...
For the one that once was me
Entombed remains
A gravestone marks I've passed away...
(Sacred... to the memory of myself)

I've dragged myself through the blood and mud
and with burning eyes pushed the love away'
No, I'm not the kind of man who'd play for keeps'
The enchantment lies in the moment of goodbyes

For eternity
My sun has set down
I dream to flee
As I suffer "the black" bleed into me

I regret every single day
I ever lived in my life
I gave all I had in me
So it's time to say Goodbye

The breath of wind beneath my beating wings
is slowly dying down
Yet raging it's final blow!
As it crumbles down' my castle in the air
The relieving words of farewell end my earthly Hell

For eternity
My sun has set down
It has ceased to be
The lightning that once burned in me

I regret every single day
I ever lived in my life
I gave all I had in me
So it's time to say Goodbye

Yes, autumn's here again
to put all forms of life to an end
Death has taken over and slowly fades the light away
The deadly shadows fall
and the bleeding sun sinks down below
The first flakes of snow guide me on my last pathway

Alive no more
What once was green has turned to red
Leaves start their fall
Gray with the whiteness of what's dead

The wintry frost comes crawling
freezing all life that's on its way
The first dead leaves come falling,
hovering in the air with the rain

I feel the flaming frost
I feel the burning ice and snow for the first time
since the night she was taken away

Alive no more
What once was green has turned to red
Leaves lightly fall
Gray with the whiteness of what's dead

The wintry frost comes crawling
ceasing all life that's on its way
Dead frozen leaves come falling,
hovering in the air with the rain
'hovering in the air'

“And as the last leaf hovers down upon the ground,
the end is at hand - I'll find the one I came looking for'"

Alive no more
What once was green has turned to red
Leaves lightly fall
Gray with the whiteness of what's dead

The wintry frost comes crawling
freezing all life that's on its way
The last dead leaves come falling,
hovering in the air with the rain

The End of Life comes crawling
ceasing my bleeding heart and now;
The last dead leaf comes falling,
hovering lightly down upon the ground
'upon the frozen ground'

The silent peace this anguished morning brings leaves me to my grief
Oh, so many years I've been married to the grave
These bitter tears fill up my sorrowed eyes as I lay my head down
and beg myself to be so brave

Oh, how I miss your loving hate
And yet I miss her loving hate

Cursed be this love I bear
Bereaved be this heart that bleeds for her
The love of the man lives here
On grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air

The burning passion the glowing sunset gives will leave me to my joy
and I'll laugh upon the stroke that murders me
So farewell my love, take all of myself and kill this love forsaken
and please send me no need of thee

Oh, how I miss your loving hate
And yet I miss her loving hate

Cursed be this love I bear
Bereaved be this heart that bleeds for her
The love of the man lives here
On grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air
rain and the chilling air

Cursed be this love I bear
Bereaved be this heart that bleeds for her
The love of the man lives here
On grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air
On grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air
On grain and the earth, rain and the chilling…
rain and the chilling air

The stars shine down on the crimson sky
As the night falls upon
The pain arrives and hurts like a twist of a knife
It makes him wish to be gone

So he's facing the curtain descending with a razorblade smile
He's taken "the path neverending" yet only to walk for a while (for a while)

He's gazing through all that is there
and sees the world left for him to despise
Blissfully feeling so dead, no glimmer in his eyes

So no more joy or forgiving, he's one with misery
Nothing left to believe in, he's reaching out to be free (to be free)

On that trail the warrior rides
chasing the fall of his soul
Life's been too dire so the fullest desire has died
deep from inside (inside)

On that trail the warrior rides
chasing the fall of his soul
Life's been too dire so the fullest desire has died
deep from inside

On that trail the warrior rides
from the cradle straight to the grave
Within his heart he feels his soul's being barred
yet aberrant (aberrant)

"'.I am the light that shall lead you to darkness'"
Well, here I am, I'm back again
From the Deadlands I descend'
back from the dead, back from The End
'I'm here to take Revenge!

Soon the deathly dusk will fall
and the Night I've waited for
'at the dawn you'll live no more
Breathing through Death' Living for Bloodshed'
I'm the Suicider dying every night and day
Killing me is not enough to make me go away

I live to kill and kill to live
And long for dying endlessly
Each time I kill I'm born again
'I have become The End

Thus I am and thus I'll die
yet another thousand times
'I am dead and I am alive
Take a deep breath'
It's the last one you will get!!!

I'm the Suicider dying every night and day
Killing me is not enough to make me go away
I'm the Suicider seeking for the End of Life
(But) killing me is not enough to cease the flame inside
'Thus I kill and thus I`ll die'
Thus I will live for all time

I'm the suicider dying every night and day
Killing me is not enough to make me go away

I'm the suicider seeking for the end of life
But killing me is not enough to cease the flame inside

…the flame inside

now every single cloud becomes a raging storm
As I go seeking for the one I used to live for

since your love was taken away
my heart's been beating empty beats
Well, it will end tonight
-the blade shall set me free

a steady hand with this sharpened cold steel
will help me wipe away this pain that I feel

the rain comes falling down
my life flows to the ground
no longer feeling the pain
my flame now fading away

the rain comes falling down
my life flows to the ground
no longer feeling the pain
my flame now fading away

so here I'm lying on these dead and bloody autumn leaves
Waiting for death to take me where I want to be

a steady hand with this sharpened hard steel
will help me wipe away this agony I feel

the rain comes falling down
my life flows to the ground
no longer feeling the pain
my flame now fading away

the rain comes falling down
my life flows to the ground
no longer feeling the pain
these leaves now becoming my grave

no longer feeling the flame
no longer feeling the rain

I have seen my funeral in a thousand dreams
Its beauty'
Now the night descends
and drowns me in this dream once again'
No stars tonight' they all have ceased
No moon tonight to cast its gleam
'just a single flame lighting my journey'
Two at my feet, and two at my head
Two carrying me at where my hands are laid

Endless sleep' giving me peace
and eternally bringing release
Nothing more to be done
Nothing more to be lived for me

All my life I've waited for this eternal night
and now it's time'
soon they'll lower me down deep into the icy ground

Two at my feet, and two at my head
Two carrying me at where my hands are laid
'and once there'll be a time that I have waited for
when the dawn will steal my dreams no more'

Two at my feet, and two at my head
Two carrying me at where my hands are laid

Grave Sweet Grave - welcoming me home
Grave Sweet Grave - I'll be yours till the dawn
(the dawn shall steal my dreams no more)

Just take the flame and Burn Yourself'
-Burn the pain away!!!

Take this love, my dear
And cherish it in your heart
You shall have no fear
Nothing could tear us apart

Accept this love sincere
from the bottom of my heart
For now our time is here
and love shall heal the scars

Now twilight hides the clear
and haunts the day away
We cross the last frontier
and it sets our hearts ablaze

The Waves lie still and gleaming on Our Sea
and we're drifting down the stream

Let's drown ourselves in this love
(my darling, my only one)
Let's give our lives for this love
We are in make it forever

Let me dry your tears
and hold you in embrace
‘til we disappear
in the crimson haze

The Flames rise still so freezing on Our Sea
and we're drifting down the stream

Let's drown ourselves in this love
(my darling, my only one)
Let's give our lives for this love
We are in do it together

And we take our dive into the waters of eternity
Here all pain has died and the only ones are you and me

The Haze lies still and bleeding on Our Sea
And we're drifting down the stream

Let's drown ourselves in this love
(my darling, my only one)
Set sacrifices for this love
We are in make it forever

Let's drown ourselves in this love
Let's give our lives for this love
We are in do it together

(my darling, my only one)
(my darling, my only one)

Yeah!

Now everything
that used to matter to me
is taken away
forever gone

The only things
I really have left here
in this life
are bitter hate and this fucking gun

From this trip I'm taking now
I'm never coming back

It's time, tonight's the night
the last one of my life
This time I'll just let myself go
and leave this world behind

The booze flows in
like blood to heart that beats no more
and blows the flame of fear out

I raise the gun
my finger on the trigger
and put the barrel into my mouth

From this trip I'm taking now
I'm never coming back

It's time, tonight's the night
the last one of my life
This time I'll just let myself go
and leave this world behind

It's here, tonight's the night
the last one of my life
With no fear I'll just let my life go
and take the six-feet-dive

From this trip I'm taking now
I'm never coming back

It's time, tonight's the night
the last one of my life
This time I'll just let myself go
and leave this world behind

It's here, tonight's the night
the last one of my life
With no fear I'll just let my life go
and take the six-feet-dive

Let go!

No, you don't want me to be there
To kiss your eyes, caress your hair or kill that pain away
As pain is my companion, solitude my guide
Your sweet affection solely offers me a threat I cannot abide

Yet you'll lose yourself in me in me

Bleed in my arms wounds within
Fall from grace as I offer you sin
Sacrifice yourself so frail
This pseudo-love is as good as betrayal

So place your love in the palm of my hand
where temptation lies within that something you've yet to feel
And as I close my fist and awake your sleeping fears
Without forbearance I will quench my thirst of your crimson tears

You've lost yourself in me in me

Bleed in my arms wounds within
Fall from grace as I offer you sin
Sacrifice yourself so frail
This pseudo-love is as good as betrayal

Weep for promises which all died
A drop of tear for every lie
Love forever torn away
I am only to cherish your pain

I am only to cherish your pain

Again the sky has fallen down on me
Once more a world has crumbled down and over me

And yet in some twisted way
I enjoy my misery
And in some strange way
I have grown together with my agony

I feel home in despair for I dwell in grief
and I feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
and I feel home anywhere human lives are going down the drain

For as long as I remember life has been hard
I guess they have "misery" written somewhere in my stars

For I have mourned for so damn long
that I've forgotten what it was for
Everything has gone so wrong
that I really couldn't think of anything more

I feel home in despair for I dwell in grief
and I feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
and I feel home anywhere human lives are flowing down the drain

I feel home in despair for I dwell in grief
and I feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
and I feel home anywhere the light of day is drowned in heavy rain

Yet I know the worst is still to come

So many times I have brought you down
that I have already lost all count
and I seem to be doing it again
No matter how hard I have tried
I have crumbled time after time
and kept failing in the end

Sometimes it feels it would be better for you all
If I ceased to exist or was never born at all

So many times I have let you down
shadowed the shine of our sun
and drowned you in tears and misery
that it is hard for me to see
how you can after all these years
still be standing by me

Sometimes it feels it would be better for us all
If I ceased to exist or was never born at all
Sometimes it feels it would be easier to fall
than to flutter in the air with these wings so weak and torn

She was no longer precious to me
I guess my hate grew much stronger than my love for her ever did
(I was) so tired of chasing that person who made me feel loved
and as we were embracing I cut and spilt the dearest blood

I'm praying for her soul as this blood on my hands stains me whole

You were my life, from you I fed of
And now parted by knife - the suicide of our love
So callous and frigid was that stillborn soul
yet no other half could ever make me whole

You promised: "'til death do us part", and then you made a stone of my heart
And with the last rays of the setting sun the loveless pulse fades away
No more beating as one, no longer burns the flame

Gone are the times when I felt alive
Gone are those nights with you by my side
And now here I stand as the shadows grow deep
With the death on my hand at your grave I weep

We were one yet not the same
Once passion abundant, now pain

And with the last rays of the setting sun the loveless pulse fades away
No more beating as one, no longer burns the flame

Love laved with stillness like the grave in my heart
and all the reasons huddled in your seeping blood

And with the last rays of the setting sun the loveless pulse fades away
No more beating as one, no longer burns the flame
And with the last rays of the setting sun she bled her love away
No more beating as one, no longer burns the flame

I have come a long way where I started from
but I'm still not even close to where I'm going
(and now) I can no longer see the shine
that has been lighting up my way
I cannot feel its glowing

The fire in my heart is dying
and the zeal I had is gone

This path that I've chosen's a rocky one
Long, hard and frozen it has become
Each turn that I've taken on the way
has only led me back to Hell
I am dying down growing weaker now
It could seem that I'm doing fine
but I'm broken to little pieces deep inside

Why did I ever choose to go this way
The question I keep asking myself all the time
I guess it was my instinct for self-destruction
that pointed me down this way

The fire in my eyes is dying
and the dream I had is gone

This path that I've chosen's a rocky one
Long, hard and frozen it has become
Each turn that I've taken on the way
has only led me back to Hell
I am dying down growing weaker now
It could seem that I'm doing fine
but I'm broken to little pieces deep inside

Baby, have you seen, there is a snake in our paradise
A serpent that's wriggling between us
and freezing our feelings to ice

And with each drop of blood we bleed because of this
something so precious dies and it feels it really is...

Killing Me Killing You
Killing all we have
As our loves wither away

Burning Me Burning You
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flames

Darling, do you feel, there is a storm coming our way
The burning light between us is already starting to fade
The fire in our hearts is smothered by the rain
and the crimson flame of passion turns into something gray

And with each drop of blood our shattered hearts ever bleed
something so precious dies and is lost eternally

Killing Me Killing You
Killing all we have
As our loves wither away

Burning Me Burning You
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flames

Each teardrop from your eyes
makes something inside me die
Each of these days that draws us part
takes a piece from my heart

Kill me kill me kill me again with your love
and chase the storm away
Bring me bring me bring me the end with your love
and haunt the demons away

Killing Me Killing You
Killing all we have
As our loves wither away

Burning Me Burning You
Burning us to ash
Drowning us in a sea of flames

Kill me kill me kill me again with your love
and chase the snake away
Bring me bring me bring me the end with your love
and haunt the serpent away

The darkness comes out of her shell
Yet another cold night in Hell with all the pain
The dying light is losing its glow
And my last glimmer of hope now fades away

It is starting to rain again
I'm coming closer to my end with every breath
The creepy shadows are growing pale
And the rising glow brings along the sense of death

I can feel Her presence now

Dead Moon Rising
Bleeding red light over the sea
- I hope this time She came for me
- I hope this time She sets me free

My wounds are open wide
The freezing wind blows right inside and feels like ice
The eerie glow fires up the sky
And She takes away my sight with Her shine

I can feel Her all around

Dead Moon Rising
Bleeding dead light over the sea
- I hope this time She came for me
- I hope this time She sets me free

Dead Moon Rising
Bleeding dead light over the sea
- I hope this time She came for me
- I hope this time She sets me free

Yet another morning
that feels like this
Yet another life's bitter kiss

It has been like this for I don't know how long
I only know that at some point
it all went wrong

I don't remember much from last night
but still far more than I would like to

I'm floating downstream that damned river again

What can I do now except continue
and open a bottle once more
What can I do now except see this through
and float with the stream, off the shore
- see where the river will take me

When I needed you, you weren't there
now I need booze like I need the air that I breathe

With each drink I'm drifting further away from your world
the further off I get the harder it will be to return

It has been like this for I don't know how long
I only know that at some point
it all went wrong

Floating downstream that damned river again
The river that's distilled from premium grain

What can I do now except continue
and open a bottle once more
What can I do now except see this through
and float with the stream, off the shore
- see where the river will take me
- see where the river will take me

It feels that your love for me
is slowly turning to dust
It seems that our union made of iron
is starting to rust

I hate life
I hate this shit
I love you and I hate myself
I hate our world
and everything in it
I hate loving you
I hate
I hate

Give me a reason to live
one more day
Let me just once more feel
your light through the rain

It feels that my love for you
is eternal, never-ending
but it seems that you're not receiving
what I have been sending

I love life
I love this shit
I love you and I hate myself
I love our world
and everything in it
I love loving you
I love
I hate

Give me a reason to live
one more day
Let me just once more feel
your light trough the rain

Give me a reason to live
one more day
Let me just once more feel
your love through the pain

It has now spread itself all over inside me
all the way to the brain and down to my knees
My time comes closer with each day it lets me see
- with each night the pain keeps me from sleep

Life has given me much - maybe taken more
but those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time for goodbyes I will leave grieving and yet so relieved
with bitterness and joy

Pleasure and pain; Heaven and Hell - my memories
What a long and strange trip this has been for me
What a short and strange life this has been

It has given me much - maybe taken more
but those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time to take leave of this world
I will leave with bitterness and joy

What a long and strange trip this has been for me
What a short and strange life this has been

It has given me much - maybe taken more
but those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time for goodbyes I will leave grieving and yet so relieved
with bitterness and joy

Life has given me much - maybe taken more
but those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time to take leave of this world
I will leave with bitterness and joy

I gave and gave - gave all I had
I took and took - all I could grab
I had it all and I had none
Now the game is over and it's all gone

My heart is worn out to keep beating
My lungs exhausted by all this breathing
My mind's too tired to keep grieving

I was against and I was for
I wanted less and wanted more
I won I lost, I lost and won
Now it's all over and I am done

My throat is too sore for more screaming
My eyes too swollen for more weeping
My wounds are too dry for more bleeding
My blood too drained for more streaming

My heart is slowing down

Long short is life is short and long
Strong weak am I am weak and strong
My crop is ready for the Reaping
My being ready for releasing

My heart is slowing down

"They call themselves my brothers. For me they're just the others."

Rain drums the lifeless ground
Drops as cold as ice
The dawn's breaking, the trench a-shaking...
Their fire hits us all around
And the siren cries
"Forward! Forward!" - We go into attack!

May today become the day...
As I plunge into the gray
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think that I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I've gotta say that ain't how it's like

Closing in, not slowing down
Iron, fire, blood
Our line's breaking and death a-taking...
Our men from all around
Into the pools of mud
Forward, forward... There is no turning back!

May today become the day...
As I plunge into the gray
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think that I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I've gotta say that ain't not how it's like

The fall back -calling as our soldiers keep falling
No, forward, forward! I am not turning back!

May today become the day...
As I plunge into the gray
Lead is flying, all the signs are there
They all think that I am brave
The strongest link of our chain
But really I.. just want a bullet between my eyes
Aim high.

The accusations and the blame
True or false, they seem the same
Filthy fingers, rising rose
And out of shit a flower grows
I'm amazed how damn low
People can go only by being themselves

Those with hearts of Ever-frost
Always know we never lost
Flames rose high...
Not enough to melt the ice
Tiny minds and virtuous whores
Bunch of morons with a cause
"Jesus saves?" - We will piss upon your graves

Three wise men came to the north
On they donkeys they rode forth
Whining I'd committed sins
Moaning I'm to everything
Still amazed how our whole trio on link
Can have only two brain cells

Those with hearts of Ever-frost
Always knowing ever lost
Acid rain, urine on your flames
Urine on your flames

Those with hearts of Ever-frost
Always know we never lost
Flames rose high...
Not enough to melt the ice
Tiny minds and virtuous whores
Bunch of morons with a cause
"Jesus saves?" - We will piss upon your graves

Placid rain, urine on your graves


Think of your lifetime as one day
It's fading away
The shadows are growing long
Think of existence as a flame and death as rain
Storm clouds - they ride along

At life's eve our flames will cease
Eternally, unavoidably
Eventually all paths will lead
To the cemetery

We are but falling leaves in the air hovering down
On our way we are spinning around
Scattered fragments of time
Like blinks of an eye we are
That's all we are

Think of your lifetime as one year
Look autumn is here
Getting colder, the winter's impending
Your conclusion's drawing near-certain, austere
Yet is only the circles unending

At life's eve our flames will cease
Eternally, unavoidably
Eventually, all paths will lead to the cemetery
To the prior deceased

We are but falling leaves in the air hovering down
On our way we will hit the ground
Scattered fragments of time
Like blinks of an eye we are

Just when we realize that we are alive, we die

Must have been a week
Since she drew the curtains down
I don't know if it's night or day
And I don't care
Our hope seems so bleak
But she's pulling through somehow
While I'm trembling in dismay, in despair

I can see you're scared and tired of all this
I can see the torment, the damage it has done
Still we both know what the other alternative is
Not yet, the only one

The good moments are breezed
And there's nothing I can do
When it comes onto her again
And does it worse

She shivers like a leaf
As the waves of pain heave through
The ruthless bringer of the end
Fears, preserved

I can see you're scared and tired of all this
I can see the torment, the damage she has done
Still we both know what the other alternative is
Not yet, the only one

Don't go yet, don't yet go
Not yet, my only one
Don't go yet, I can't let go
Not yet, my only one

"I can't stop the light from flaming the curtains white."

All bridges... on fire!
As onward and onward we ride
The smoke rises higher, higher...
Up the ever-darkening sky
So quickly everything swirled; descent of the world
Now it's all a chaotic ruin

Burning eerie, sapphire
The foretoken of closing doom
Glowing dreadful and dire, dire...
Is the ever-haunting moon
So sickly everything twirled; the end of the world
Now it's all a chaotic ruin

We came so far
So deeply wounded and so scarred our despair-ridden hearts
Frail as we are
Firmly united we will stand 'til the world falls apart

I am stunned, you caught me by surprise
It's so damn wrong, you outdid yourselves
Beaten numb, I didn't see you sneaking round the corner, how could I?
There is no sight in my third eye

When I'm done I will hunt you down
One by one I'll blow you all to hell
For you faceless, nameless, cowards, cannot hide
The day of reckoning will arrive

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down, stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest
I rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine, from the rage
I'm right on your track you bastards
Dozen of eyes for an eye
Vengeance is mine

I have dreams of hammering your skulls
Fantasies of bashing in your brains
Obsessively I am watching, I am stalking, I am following
And then the massacre begins

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down, stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest
I rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine, from the rage
I'm right on your track, you bastards
Dozen of eyes for an eye
Vengeance is mine

Strike from behind and knock me to the ground
Kick me while I'm down, stab me in the back, you bastards
Tear my heart out of my chest
I rise from the ashes, from these ruins of mine, from the rage
I'm right on your track you bastards
Dozen of eyes for an eye
Vengeance is mine
Dozen of eyes for an eye
Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine

Approaching the moment now
Long hard journey in its end
Starting to loom right now,
The final round and then it hits you
It kicks you, it slicks you in hell

All the toil and all exhaustion
All those times we hated
All the losses, sacrifices
All those things were missed
All the suffering and distortion
Shit we tolerated
All that we abandoned
All for this

Our scattered hope fall down
The zeal turns to negligence
The shattered dreams all down
Crumbled around

That's when it shakes you
It quakes you, it breaks you
It kades you, it fades you
Degrades you in laughs

Enough, enough, too much is more than we can take
All those hits we took, persistence was in vain
Enough, enough, too much is all than I can feel
Down the drain
Just bitterness remains

It shakes you, it quakes you
It breaks you, it hates you
Degrades you in laughs

All the battles, all the dirts and victories we tasted
All the tension, all the misery and all the bless
All the passion, all the hurt and all the love we wasted
All the purgatories, all for this

There's nothing else...

Feel it... And how it's weighing in your hand
Cold and loaded
See it... Oh, how it's shining in my hand
Cold and loaded
I know I haven't got the balls to pull this through
And therefore I'm laying all my faith in you

Raise the gun, take aim and shoot me
Put a bullet through my head
Consider us dead
Raise the gun, take aim and blow me away
Squeeze the trigger, free the lead
Consider us dead

We're leaving... this human ruin behind
Too cold and empty...
Yes leaving... for there's nothing more I can find
In this cold and empty
The choice is mine so don't be afraid to pull this through
Just get a grip, I'm dying to get rid of you

Raise the gun, take aim and shoot me
Put a bullet through my head
Consider us dead
Raise the gun, take aim and blow me away
Squeeze the trigger, free the lead
Consider us dead

I know you haven't got the balls to pull this through
Just get a grip, I'm dying to get rid of you.

He's gone, he is dead
His remains upon the hearse ahead
As silently we wander though the mist
He's free

This is the end
Your journey's over, night descends
Below... Into the abyss
Farewell, my friend, you will be missed

Lower the flags
A good man has passed
He has reached the last of frontiers
Lower the flags
Down to half-mast
For again the world has taken a turn for the worse

He's done, he is dead
Six feet of earth upon his head
Now lay your wreaths
Upon the one who lies beneath

Although you're gone
In memories you shall live on
Asleep... In peace now rest
The weight of the world is off your chest

Lower the flags
A good man has passed
He has reached the last of frontiers
Lower the flags
Down to half-mast
For again the world has taken a turn for the worse

That morning light I'll always remember
And these August nights: cold as December.

Always pretending to want you
It's so easy to make you play my game
Always deceiving to get you
So goddamn easy to make you scream my name
No remorse, no repent
Still to you I'm heaven-sent

I don't need a reason to hate you
I don't need a reason to break you
Just keep that mouth wide open and drain me, my darling
I don't need to care if you want me
I don't need to care if you need me
Just spread that pink wide smile and drain me, my darling

For so many years I've been faking
It's so hard to keep lying and smiling in vain
For so many years I've been taking
Innocence soiled, hey babe, your loss is my gain
No remorse, no repent
Still to you I'm heaven-sent

I don't need a reason to hate you
I don't need a reason to break you
Just keep that mouth wide open and drain me, my darling
I don't need to care if you want me
I don't need to care if you need me
Just spread that pink wide smile and drain me, my darling

Here we are, now lay the burden down
We're coming to the end of our road
Sorrowful yet glorious somehow
To be humming this one last ode
So calm and still... it wasn't all that bad, or was it now?
Fulfilled... it doesn't only hurt to end it now

The funeral

The memories beneath the dust of years
They seem like those of someone deceased
There's no more to be done, or hoped or feared
Just waiting for the final release
So calm and thrilled... it wasn't all that bad, or was it now?
Still it doesn't only hurt end it now

Is life over, this life's over?
Or has it only just begun?
It grows colder, starts to moulder...
Coming apart yet still not done
Forever one
