See I'm going through a situation
That I can't help
Wanna get a little closer
But I promised myself
That I would never give my heart
Away again
Oo oo babe, I know it's hard
Butcha gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the shit that you get
When you have it
Ain't worth it
I've been there so many times
I should know better but I
Can't stop what I feel
When you're next to me
I really think I

Finally found somebody
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one

(Baby you're the one)
(Baby you're the one)

See the problem with relationships
In general is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do
Anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same
And I, know everyone out there can relate
So the question is
One: do I really wanna trust this feeling
Two: do I wanna let it pass me by
Three: do you think it's only superficial
Four: could it actually be different this time
Someone to love me
Someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon

Finally found somebody (The only one)
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love (No, no)
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous (I just don't wanna be hurt)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(But boy I think you might be the one)
Finally found somebody
That could be the one (Maybe I've found)
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous (Boy I'm so afraid)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
('Cause I know you're the one)

Oh baby
Sweet darling
I
I think I finally found

Finally found somebody (The only one)
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous (No)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
(I don't wanna be hurt anymore)
This is bad 'cause I know that you're the one
(But I think you might really be the one)
Finally found somebody
Could be the one, but I promised myself (Finally found)
That I wouldn't give in to love
(I promised myself not to give in)
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous
This is bad
(Anymore this is bad)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
('Cause I know that you're the one)
Finally found somebody
Could be the one
(I finally found somebody that could be the one)
But I promised myself
(But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love)
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
(And I'm scared)
And I'm nervous
(And I'm nervous)
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
(Please, please baby baby)
Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

Hey boy, what's going on
Thanks, I'm doing okay
Don't believe rumours- hey
How's your family
Please say hello for me
Guess we've both grown up a bit
But I have to admit
It really still feels good
Here by your side
Sitting right next to you
Just like I used to do
You know we can't deny
No one else in our lives
Holds a candle to you and I

Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

So here we are again
All by ourselves
So familiar you know
That it actually almost feels like deja vu
Of that night on the roof
We kissed under the sky amid city lights
A sudden flashback to so long ago
In the dark all alone
With our bodies this close
Guess some things never change
'Cause I still melt away
When you touch me
And say my name

Should just hug you goodbye (baby)
But I just can't walk away from paradise (so I guess)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(I'll come and love you to sleep)
And we can revisit us one more time
(revisit paradise for a while)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight (by your side)
(lullaby)

I should just hug you goodbye (see I know I should but boy)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(you just look so good)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(so I'll sing that song)
And we can revisit us one more time
(you like to hear me sing as we revisit us)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

(It feels, feels good)

I should just hug you goodbye
(I can't walk away
But I just can't walk away from paradise
From paradise so I'll take you home and sing to you baby)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(though I know that I should just)

I should just hug you goodbye
(oh I can't, ...cause you)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(you and I both know)
And we can revisit us one more time
(nobody else in our lives holds a candle to you and I)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

I should just hug you goodbye shhh!
(so hush pretty baby)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(mmm,it's just me and you yeah, as we relive the splendour of you and I)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
(I'm gonna sing our sweet lullaby) 
I should've left it at, how ya doin'
I should've left it at
I like your music too, and
I should've never called you back
When you pursued me
I should've never given you
My fucking N two way
I should've never listened
To your woeful stories
The ones I'm sure you
Told a thousand times before me
You should've never intimated
We were lovers
When you know very well
We never even touched each other

Who's gonna love you when
It all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when
Your bankroll runs out
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the
Show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
Fall down...
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
Fall down

I gotta break it to ya delicately, dunny
Takin' my g5 twenty minutes wasn't nothin'
But I guess you wouldn't know
That's the way I roll
Consequently now your ego's fully
Overblown
You don't want the world to know
That you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside
Often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries
(Boo hoo. Who?)

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you
When your bankroll runs out
(When your bankroll runs out)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the
Show isn't you anymore
Nobody (Nobody)

Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become
Sure you hide it
But you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
(Tell me who's gonna love you? Who? I'd like to know)
Who's gonna love you when
Your bankroll runs out
(If you didn't have nothing)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
(Who, who'd still be there)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, oh)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(There ain't nobody baby)
Fall down...
(Bullies in the schoolyard)
(When they fall they fall hard)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(Yeah... so you)
Fall down
(Better think twice, better play nice)
('Cause who's gonna be there)

Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
(When the jokes on you)
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out
(A marionette show)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
(Who's makin' you move though)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(I know what kills you slow)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(I'm gonna keep your little)
Fall down
(Secret though, mmmm, hmmmm)
(And you know that I know)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(You're no superhero)
Fall down...
(I guess your mamma never told you that what goes around comes around. Pow) 
Ah) My girl 
Got a new boyfriend 
Yeah 
Yeah (Oh) 
K-I-S-S-I-N-G 


(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby 
(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby 
(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby 
(Whooooooooooooooo)

Mariah: 
I got myself a lover 
Who loves what I like 
When he invites me over 
I come every time 
Oh my sugar daddy 
Takes me for a ride 
Whatever way we're going 
I expect to leave on time 

He's all mine 
And his loving makes me high 
Like a taste of ecstasy 
All I need is him to be my loverboy 

Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me

And he's so sublime 
He's quite a bit of heaven 
When he comes inside 
So come on sugar daddy 
Take me for a ride 
Whatever way we're going next 
I expect to leave on time 

I get weak 
And his candy's just so sweet 
When he caressed my whole body 
All I need is him to be my loverboy 

Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
(I enjoy the way you rock me)

Cameo: 
This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now 
It's the same feeling 
I always seem to get around you (Yes I do) 
Cause you affect me 
Fascinate me 
I thank heaven for the things that you do 
This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now (Whoo) 

My thoughts flow in my head 
I toss and turn in my bed 
In the morning when I think about you (Candy) 
Simply put, you're the reason why 
Even though I'm real shy 
It's like candy 
I attempt to look my best for you (Indeed I do) 

Mariah: 
Loverboy 
Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
(I enjoy the way you rock me) 
Loverboy come on and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation 
All night long (Strawberry) 
Loverboy come on and take me (Raspberry) 
Only you know how to make me (All those good things) 
Shudder with anticipation (Diamonds and gumdrops) 
All night long (That's what you seem to me) 
Oh loverboy 
Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
Loverboy come on and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation 
All night long

I would love you unconditionally

promise I would be by your side
be everything you need to get by
my broken heart would finally mend
darlin' if we were together again

Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
but if I had a chance to do it all again
sometimes for happiness we hesitate
just like the game I hear that love won't wait
but if I had another best friend
well if I had someone who would go deep and
someone who makes me feel like you used to
tell me baby what would you do

If we got together again
sugar I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
you'd never wanna let me go baby
promise I would be by your side
be everything you need to get by
my broken heart would finally mend
darlin' if we were together again

Why would you go through the pain
of loving another man
truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame we can't get along
we used to get it on where'd did it all go wrong
I admit the flesh is weak but the game is strong
we go my way your way baby we moving on
It's true I'm gonna miss you
who woulda thought that I'd be without you

I never thought
(baby theres nothing to lose)
that I'd be
(you know my souls so cold)
without you
(and my love is pain)

(baby one more time)

I never thought
(my baby)

On me, askin' me, off that ecstasy
Reminiscin' how we used to smoke and freak
Then fall asleep, lockin' for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up, girl we losin' touch

Sometimes for happiness we hessitate
Just like the game, I need the love, won't wait
And if I had another best friend
What if I had someone on whom I could depend?
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me baby, what would you do?

Without you (and my love is pain)
By me (spit it one more time)
I never thought (my baby)
Thought I'd be (pride and joy)
Without you (I'ma make you mine)
By me (no doubt, whoa)


See it's hard to tell somebody
That you're still somewhat
Attached to the dream
Of being in love once again
When it's clear they've moved

So I sat down and wrote these few words
On the off chance you'd hear
And if you happen to be somewhere listening
You should know I'm still here

If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in

What can I say, I had a little extra time
So I figured I might as well explain
A couple little things to you
That you probably never knew
Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me
Even though life goes on

If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in

And in my love will flow
Like the waves to the shore
You can fall into me
Once again effortlessly
And I'll comfort you so

Your heart won't hurt anymore
I'm waiting patiently

If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
(if she hurts you or misleads you) Is call me and let love rush in
(you can just call me baby)
If you really need me (if you really need me baby)
Baby just reach out and touch me(reach reach baby)
(reach, baby)
You don't ever have to be
(don't ever hesitate to call me)
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you(if she hurts you)
(she's a dam fool)
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
(all you gotta do is call me boy, I got you)

If you really need me (yeah:.)
Baby just reach out and touch me
(if you're listening to me baby)
You don't ever have to be (like you used to)
Downhearted again
(before I even knew you)
If she hurts you or misleads you
(then you know I'm singing to you)
Baby all you ever need to do
(so I just wanted you to know)
Is call me and let love rush in
(that 'anytime you need a friend')

If you really need me (I'm here)
Baby just reach out and touch me
(you can still believe
You don't ever have to be in fairy tales)
Downhearted again (yours and mine)
If she hurts you or misleads you
(so if by chance you take a listen)
Baby all you ever need to do
(I'm quite sure you 'know is call me and let love rush
In that this one's for you)
(cause I'm giving 'my all') 
You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to feel similarly
And led you to believe I was O.K.
To just walk away from the thing
That's unyielding and scared to me
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly loosing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry
So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't
Got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing 'I will survive'
Do you lash out and say: 'How dare you leave this way'
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly loosing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry
Bone Thugs:
Gonna break it down,
Only if you let it
Everyday the situations rackin my mind tryin to break me down
But I won't let it forget it
I be feelin like you're putting me down, kickin me 'round, stressin me
Out.
I think I better go and get out and let me release some stress.
Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)
Lord I just wanna maintain
Yeah, can feel the pressures yo, but never the less Krazy won't
Fall...it's over, it's endin here.........
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly loosing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry 
I get shy around you
Don't know what to say
I don't know what to do
'Cause you do something to me
That I can't describe baby

Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby it's true

You know you got me
So in love
You know you got me
Daydreamin' 'bout us
You know you got me
Starry eyed and elated
You know you got me
Whenever you want me baby

Boy I'm entangled up in you
These feelings I just can't elude
'Cause you're so captivating
That I inadvertantly

Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby it's true

You know you got me
So in love

Baby 
You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

Tender love's what you're giving me and
You surpass all my fantasies and
I keep thanking the Lord above for
Blessing me with oh so much

Cause I know how it feels to be
part of you boy
Everyday of my life's so abundant
With joy
And I honestly never thought love
could be real
until the angels guided you to me

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

Lying with you so natural
I never knew this was possible
And it finally feels like my life has begun
now that I can share it with someone

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

Baby our love will always persevere
Anything you ever need,
You know I'll be right here and
You don't have to worry boy
I won't betray your trust
Because I'm so much in love
Every time your lips meet mine
It still feels like the first time
And if you lost everything
I'd keep on standing by your side
And boy it seems like everyday
I fall deeper in love
Because I can't get enough

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now

Everything that you do's so amazing
Everything that you do's so amazing
Everything that you do's so amazing
Everything that you do's so amazing to me
Boy

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

(Baby I believe in miracles
because I'm baby I'm forever yours.
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours)
It wasn't raining yet
But it was definitely a little misty on
That warm november night
And my heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words I love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(Pretty baby - How I'm missing you)
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you caressing me)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On the roof that rainy night)
Every time I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)
And go back in time
(I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(It was oh so sweet you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)
Every time I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream...)
I envision you caressing me
(I was actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time
(As I whispered...That I loved you)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(...very subtly)
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
We've known each other
For a long long time
But I never really noticed
All the magic in your eyes
I've been around you
A thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more
I must have been so blind
I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't know what to do
'Cause baby

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way

I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me

But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going thru a transformation
That's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that
Finally opened up my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for
Was right here all the time
I was oblivious so very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And it's all because of you
Sweet baby

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me

But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way

I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me

But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

Don't you know
That you're blowing my mind
What you do to me
I can't describe
Baby I can't hold back anymore
I just can't conceal it
You're the one I really adore

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way

I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me

But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way

I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you 
I can't help it
When I'm not around you (Boy)
'Cause all I ever seem to
Do is drift away
In dreams about you
'Cause when I'm without you (Boy)
It always seems like
Part of me is missing baby

Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up
And makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really
Seem so bad at all

(Boy) I need you
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)
Gotta have you (Oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy)
Fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy)
When I see you (Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy

My heart races when
My Motorola beeps
Or my cell rings
I just make a wish and if it's you
My whole day changes
'Cause when I know
You're thinking of me (Boy)
Heaven knows
Suddenly it's not so dismal baby

Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up
And makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really
Seem so bad at all

(Boy) I need you
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)
Gotta have you (Oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy)
Fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy)
When I see you (Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy

I... (What?)
Need... (Who?)
You... (Uh huh, uh huh)
I wanna feel your touch... (Why wouldn't you)
So come and get my love (Show me where it's at - now sing)
I... (What?)
Need... (Who?)
You... (Uh huh, uh huh)
I'm gonna wrap you up (Wrap me up)
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy (Never let me go, girl)

(Boy) I need you
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)
Gotta have you (Oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy)
Fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy)
When I see you (Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy

Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Everytime we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible

I don't wanna lose you to somebody else
But I can't go on contradicting myself
I know that it's pointless to keep hodling on
But something inside tells me you're where I belong

Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Everytime we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible

I know that it's unrealistic to think
That things will get better
Between you and me
Cause time after time
You just shatter my heart
But when I'm without you
I feel so torn apart

Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Everytime we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible

Boy
I wish
That I didn't
Love you so
(oh oo oh oo oh oh)
I try to tell you no
But you're irresistible
(oh oo oh oo whoah oh)

See I only want it to be like it was
When we got together and first fell in love
Sometimes it's like I'm addicted to you
This love's so consuming
I don't know what to do

Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Everytime we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so

But you're irresistible

Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Everytime we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible

Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Everytime we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible

Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When you look to my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my safety
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

(Shoe do do do do do do do)

Creeping through me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When you look to my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my safety
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

When you look to my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my safety
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My lifetime boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I must have been

It's a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When you look to my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my safety
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When you look to my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my safety
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I've finally found a man that's true
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heart it would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you

I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
Because without you beside me I can't survive
I don't wanna try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be all right
Cause I need you in my life

Thank God I found you (I'm begging you)
I was lost without you (so lost without you)
My every wish and every dream (every dream, every dream)
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight (brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you

See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess it shows
That we were destined to shine
After the rain to appreciate
And care for what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you (lost without you baby)
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life (whole life)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Sweet baby I'm so thankful
I found you

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful
I found you

I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful I found you 
Boy haven't you noticed
The gleam in my eyes
Because of you
I'm a little hypnotized
But everytime you're with me
Feel so positive
That with you a little love
Somethings gotta give
Hook:
A full moon is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon you will come to be my knight
Here we are
Hoping that we'll never part
Stay with me
Baby won't you be my sweetheart
We can share a a story book romance
Just deep in love
You ain't no Casanova
I'll know that you'll be true
And that's why
I'm so in love with you
But this romantic evening
You led me at my door
But tonight, I'd like us to explore
Hook:
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

See, I saw you in the party
With your eyes on me
Fittin' the description
On what I want my bride to be (ha, ha)
As live as me
Don't know the same guys as me
But a lot of style
And usin' wild name like Ivory
I agree with my niggas
You the baddest
I ever seen in a long time (uh)
But woman with her own shine
Is her own time
And I don't hit
Cuz I'm tired of dealin'
With the wrong kind
Getting non' but the bullshit
She got a playa
Tryin' to think of new things to say (sup, baby)
She up in the corner
Sippin' Don P, Rosee (yeah)
Sippin' it up with the homegirls
Payin' no attention to us
They in they own world
'Hey, yo, girl'
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart
Stars are bright
The mood is right
To keep me warm
Away from harm
Nowhere better than my baby's arms
Sounds so right
The mood is right
To keep me warm
Away from harm
Won't you be my
Sweetheart
D'you know I need your love
Romance 
It's 2:11 and I'm stressing
Watching Tv in my hotel suite
I check my service every second
At 2:10 you still hadn't called me
So I'm gonna leave my cell phone
Turned on in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check my machine
Again and again because I'm
Obsessing on you
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll

Zoning out thinking about
You and me between the sheets
I want to get intimate
But you're not within my reach
So I'll have a little more wine
And I'll try to drink you
Out of my head
And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough I can
Forget about you until
I wake up again

I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll

Slipping into dreams
I feel my love surround you
Ny subconscious seems
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
'Cause I won't be waiting long

I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me
You wanna be my babydoll

I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on
And whisper softly to me

Give me your love

Hey
You gotta bounce to it like this
You almost kinda watching this
Uh huh
Escape

Boy your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I know I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I can not resist
And oh..

Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Hold me, feeling now
Go and break my heart

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back consistantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Give me your love

It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things that you know
Understatement to relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all

She wanna shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with 5 of her friends
She wanna creep past the block spyin' again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase the skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She call me 'Heartbreaker'
When we apart, it makes her
Wanna get a piece of paper, scribble 'I hate ya'
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does
And uh...

Give me your love

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life
Cause I was sittin' there bored to death
And in just one breath he said
You gotta get up
You gotta get on
You gotta get down girl
You know you drive me crazy baby
You've got me turning to another man
Called you on the phone
No one's home
Baby why ya leave me all alone
And if it wasn't for the music
I don't know what I'd do

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song

You know I hopped into my car
Didn't get very far no
Because I had you on my mind
Why be so unkind?
You've got your women all around
All around this town, boy
But I was trapped in love with you
And I didn't know what to do
But when I turned on my radio
I found out all I needed to know
Check it out

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song

Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song

Hey listen up to your local DJ
You better hear what he's got to say
There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix
And if your man gives you trouble
Just you move out on the double
And you don't let it trouble your brain
Cause away goes troubles
Down the drain
I said away goes troubles
Down the drain

Last night a DJ saved my life
There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix
There's not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it in the mix

And you're the only one
Who makes me come running
Cause what you got
Is far beyond compare (ooh)
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependancy
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey
It's like honey
When it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you
Crying for you
I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day
I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey

Ooh, woah, honey, got me hooked on you
(MC, and she won't stop)
Honey, it's like
Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know theres much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could whoa yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
Mmmyeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now Im standing here
My hearts so full, I cant explain
Seeking faith and speakin words
I never thought Id say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
They don't always happen when you ask
And its easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near, oh [Oh]
There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah) [Though hope is frail]
Though hope is frail [Its hard]
Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe [When you]
(Ohoh)
(You will when you believe)
We were as one baby
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart
Our love will never die

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

I ain't gonna cry
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably, you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart babe
Our love will never end

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

I know that you'll be back boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back boy
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby 
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true...
All I want for Christmas
Is you...

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you...
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You...

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need -
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You...

All I want for Christmas is you baby... 
When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imaged I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open my hands
And watch you rise
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

'Cause I got him on lock
And although he rejects you
Lt don't seem to affect you
'Cause you just keep trying
To get wit him

So don't, don't keep, keep calling
Hanging up the phone
When I answer I know it
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence
On the other end
'Till I hang up and you
Predictably call right back again

Hey ex-girlfriend
Whatever your name is

I'm really not amused
'Cause the things you do
Are very offensive
And sometimes straight up rude
All those late night calis and notes
On his car
Won't get you anywhere
You can call his mom
As much as you want
And he won't really care

So don't, don't keep, keep calling
Hanging up the phone
When I answer I know it
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence
On the other end
'Till I hang up and you
Predictably call right back aqain

I understand why
You want him back
But don't you know 
Well it's been a while
Since I looked into your eyes
Never dreamed I'd see you tonight
And it's interesting that I
Just don't feel a thing
For the so called love of my life

We used to be close
(but you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(but you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(all the little things we shared)

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance

See, I spent so many sleepless nights
Trying to block you from my mind
I was so convinced
I'd die without you once upon a time
Now my eyes are open and I can see
You were devious and shady
Only trifling with me

We used to be close
(but you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(but you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(all the little things we shared)

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance

Where were you when I needed you most
Would've done anything to hold you close
Would've given the world to be back in your arms
But you left me so torn apart

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance 
When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying to be saved but nobody comes
And you feel so far away that you just can't
Find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, what you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
What you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And when the rain blows, as shadows grow close don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I live one more day
And I can make it through the rain
(Yes you can)
You will make it through the rain 
I've often wondered if there's
Ever been a perfect family
I've always longed for undividedness
And sought stability

A flower taught me how to pray
But as I grew that flower changed
She started flailing in the wind
Like golden petals scattering

And I miss you dandelion
And even love you
And I wish there was a way
For me to trust you
But it hurts me every time
I try to touch you

But I miss you dandelion
And even love you

I gravitated towards a patriarch
So young predictably
I was resigned to spend my life
With a maze of misery

A boy and a girl befriended me
We're bonded through despondency
I stayed so long but finally
I fled to save my sanity

And I miss you little sis and
Little brother
And I hope you realize
L'll always love you
And although you're struggling
You will recover
And I miss you little sis and
Little brother

So many I considered
Closest to me
Turned on a dime and sold me
Out dutifully
Although that knife was chipping
Away at me
They turned their eyes away and
Went home to sleep ...

And I missed a lot of life
But l'II recover
Though I know you really like
To see me suffer
Still I wish that you and I'd
Forgive each other
'Cause I miss you, Valentine
And really loved you

I really loved you -
I tried so hard
But you drove me away
To preserve my sanity -

And I lound the strength to break away
Fly... 
I never knew
If I could believe in you
I thought I was just a diversion
And you were killing some time
My friends they told me
To leave you

They said you would never
Be mine
But you gave me your love
And you said I'm the one
You want for the rest of
Your life

Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

I was afraid
It was all a masquerade
That I was only a plaything
And you would leave me behind
But now I feel so secure
By your side
I can conquer the world
I gave you my love
And I know you're the one
I want for the rest
Of my life

Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

(I really feel it)
So much love
(I really feel it)
So much joy
(I feel it)
Sweet sweet ecstasy
'Cause you opened my eyes
And I realize
Your love is for real

Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore 
Gypsy, sittin lookin pretty
A broken rose and laughin' eyes
You're a mystery
Always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin'
Searchin for a feelin'
But it's easy come and easy go

Oh
I'm sorry but it's true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin all the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Whoah can't you see

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartache
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see
Oh

You're such a secret
Misty eyed and shady
Baby, how you hold the key
Oh, you're like a candle
Your flame slowly fadin'
Burnin' out and burnin' me
Can't you see
Just tryin' to say to you

You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin all the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartache
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see
Can't you see

No
No
No

You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You're bringin on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache

You're bringin on the heartbreak
You're bringin on the heartache 
How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave with out a trace.
When I stand here takin' every breath, for you.
You're the only one who really knew me at all.
How can you just walk away from me,
When all I can do is watch you leave.
'Cause we shared the lolly pops and the pain,
And even shared the tears.
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

So take a look at me now,
'cause there's just an empty space.
There's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face.
So take a look at me now.
There's just an empty space.
And you comin' back to me is against the odd's,
And that's what I've gotta face.

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry.
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why.
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

So take a look at me now,
There's just an empty space.
There's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face.
So take a look at me now,
See there's just an empty space,
But to wait for you is all I can do,
And that's what i've got to face......
Take a good look at me now,
'cause i'll still be standin' here........
And you comin' back to me
Is against all odd's............
That's a chance i've got to take.
Take a look at me now........ 
I've still got a lot to learn
But, at least I know where I can turn
When I'm in my times of need
Just as long
(As I know all things are possible)
Just as long as I believe

I've loved a lot, hurt a lot
Been burned a lot in my life and times
Spent precious years wrapped up in fear
With no end in sight
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free

Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
I found my saving grace within you

Yes, I've been bruised
Grew up confused
Been destitute
I've seen life from many sides
Been stigmatized
Been black and white
Felt inferior inside
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free

Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
I found my saving grace within you

And the bountiful things that you do
Lord thank you
For delivering me

And giving me peace
Giving me strength
Giving me hope when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
Always my saving grace
Pulls me through
I found my saving grace within you

(Yes you are - you're my every, everything)
Within you...
(Only, only you)
Yes lord
(Only you)
My saving grace lord is
You 
They can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I will not allow
Anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter
In what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams

'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me

They can do anything they want to you
Lf you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride
And just push them aside
See
I have learned there's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul
That they cannot possess
So I won't be afraid
And darkness will fade

'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me

No
They can't take this
Precious love
L'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me
Where I need to go

They can say anything they want to say
Try to break me down
But 1 won't face the ground
I will rise steadily
Sailing out of their reach

Oh Lord
They do try hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter
In what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams

'Cause there's a light in me that shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me


Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
Now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
Took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Although the sun will shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Mariah
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'd be together
One sweet day

And I know you're shining on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'd be together
One sweet day

Sorry I never told you
Together
All I wanted to say 
How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking
Every breath with you
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against all odds
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is
All I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause l'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
That's the chance I've qot to take

Take a look at me now 
I was wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the monn
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away
I left the worst unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the monn
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon

Nearing the edge
Oblivious I almost
Fell right over
A part of me
Will never be quite able
To feel stable
That woman-child falling inside
Was on the verge of fading
Thankfully I
Woke up in time
Guardian angel I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image
And you're still alive
(You're always alive)
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raise my head to the sky
And though time's rolls by
Still feel like that child
As I look at the monn
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon 

Trembling
Starry eyed
As you put your hand in mine...
It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were
Strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles
Went soaring above us and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of july
So starry eyed
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me
Like the wind trough the trees
I felt you sigh with a
Sweet intensity and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze
A crescent moon began to shine
And I wanted to stay
Tangled up with you among the fireflies
On that Fourth of july

Thunder clouds
Hung around
So threateningly
Ominously hovering
And the sky
Opened wide
Showering
Then you put your hand in mine
And we ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our separate ways
And I've never truly felt the way that I
Felt the Fourth of July
OUTRO
Truly I have never felt the same inside
Like that Fourth of July
Truly I could never feel the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July 
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you 
It's hard to explain
Inherently it's just always been strange
Neither here or there
Always somewhat out of place everywhere
Ambiguous
Without a sense of belonging to touch
Somewhere halfway
Feeling there's no one completely the same
Standing alone
Eager to just
Believe it's good enough to be what
You really are
But in your heart
Uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the
Outside
Early on, you face
The realization you don't
Have a space
Where you fit in
And recognize you
Were born to exist
Standing alone
Eager to just
Believe it's good enough to be what
You really are
But in your heart
Uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the
Outside
And it's hard
And it's hard
And it's hard

Irreversibly
Falling in between
And it's hard
And it's hard
To be understood
As you are
As you are
Oh, and God knows
That you're standing on your own
Blind and unguided
Into a world divided
You're thrown
Where you're never quite the same
Although you try-try and try
To tell yourself
You really are
But in your heart-uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the outside 
Love wandered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We cannot turn back
We can only turn into one
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch you fall
Whenever you call
And I'm truly inspired
Finding my soul
There in your eyes
And you
Have opened my heart
And lifted me inside
By showing me yourself
Undisguised
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch you fall
Whenever you call

And I will breathe for you each day
Comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I am inside
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch you fall
Whenever you call 
You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside.
I know it's crazy but you still can touch my heart.
And after all this time you'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same but time melts into nothing and nothing's
Changed.
I still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.
I had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.
Each day of my life I'm filled with all the joy I could find.
You know that I, I'm not the desperate type.
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp, I'll hold it with both
Hands. It's worth the risk of burning to have a second chance. No, no
No no no no I need you baby. I still believe that we can be together
(haaoo). If we believe that true love never has to end. Then we must
Know that we will love again.
I still believe (yeeaaah) someday you and me will find ourselves in
Love again. Oh baby yeah, I had a dream someday you and me will find
Ourselves in love again. I still believe (oh baby I do) some day you
And me (just give me one more try) in love again. I had a dream (I
Miss your love) someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.
I still believe (yeah I still believe) someday you and me (baby) in
Love again. 
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but didn't know
No one you'll ever find will be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself 'I just don't need her now'
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict
This ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others


Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when your down
In your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore!

Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)
And if you get down on your
knees at night
And pray to the lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I have to keep going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way


I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it happen
(Make it happen)


There ain't nothing you can do with the man
Except for shake your ass and clap your hands
And bob your head and move your feet
I ain't the type of rapper just to ride the beat
I set the track on fire,
I take the roof, the house and knock the air out your tires
It's the funk in here
Let Mystikal move you and Mariah sing

Don't stop baby (Shake your ass)
It's ecstasy (Watch yourself)
Turn me up a little higher
Baby light my fire
Tell me every little thing you wanna do (Do the thing)
Baby I'm into you (Get on the floor)
Don't stop baby (Shake your ass)
It's ecstasy (Oh, shake the whole building)
Turn me up a little higher (Sing it)
Baby light my fire
Tell me every little thing you want to do
I just want to love you (Uh bob your head and move your feet)

Heads up, look out it's bout to go down
And what they didn't know about me then, I bet they know now
I'm bout to prove my fame
So just get out the way and let me do the thing
It's on tonight 
Once upon a time you whispered softly in my ear
Loving words and fairytales that I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul and you took control
As you slowly swept me up and carried me away

You told me pretty lies
As I held on to you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace

Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Every now and then I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fools paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again and remember when
You came to my window on a dark and stormy day

Baby I need you now
Tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Baby I need you now
Tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago
You used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

It's just the way I want you baby
Oh so bad
It's just the feeling that comes over me

I had a crush on you
Painstakingly I
Would conceal the truth
You probably always knew
But I was timid like a child
Inhibited and way too shy
I'd glance but then avert my eyes
All twisted up in my desire
But I am not that girl today
Ain't a lot of time for games
I've waited and I've waited now
It's time for me to tell you
'Bout the way

It's just they way I want you baby
Oh so bad
Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you baby
Oh so bad
Every night and everyday

Baby I
Was so into you
Now I wonder why
I never pursued
You the way I wanted to

Kiss me and touch me and
Immerse your love in mine
I'll keep unraveling
As we explore our fantasies tonight
(Tell me what you like)
(Now show me what you like)

It's just the way I want you baby
So bad
Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait

You're with me
'Til the bitter end
What we had transcends
This experience
Too painful to talk about
So I'll hold it in
'Til my heart can mend
And be brave enough to love again

A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the mem'ries, there is solace

Oh, never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
When I remember

Glittering lights
Incandescent eyes
Still preserved in my mind
In the mem'ries, I'll find solace

Oh, never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
And I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
And I'll remember

A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the mem'ries, there is solace

Oh, never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
And, though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
Always remember

Love

You're never too far 
I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I'm drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love
Tonight 
Touch me baby
Lt feels so amazing
And you stimulatie me
And you make me want you
More and more

What do I do
What do I say
Does it feel good
To you this way I wanna be
All that you need
Boy what's your fantasy?
Setter hold on ready or not
Baby my love ain't gonna stop
Take it down low
Make me get high

Ooh my love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
See, all my love's for you

Baby don't you rush me, no
You got to take it slow
Just let the feeling grow
Until it overflows
Anyway you want it now
Just gotta teil me how
To give you everything
You've even dared to dream

Lsn't it bliss
To you right now
Don't be subdued
Say it out loud
Ain't it a sweet
Luscious delight
When you're immersed in my
Ocean of love

Coming on strong
Baby I've been waiting so long
Revel inside of paradise

So
Gimme some pure delectabie love
Like I'm gonna give to you
Keep coming around
'Cause I won't run out
I can't get enough of you
My love goes on

All my love's for you 
It takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that i should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without you hands
'Cause Mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would always be there
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine


'Cause Mom you always were, Mom you always were
Mom you always were, you know you always were
'Cause Mom you always were...the perfect fan

I love you Mom 
I won't see your smile
And I won't hear you
Laugh anymore
Every night
I won't see you
Walk through that door

'Cause time wasn't on
Your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to
Tell you
Bit I really need
You to know

No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby

Baby can you hear me
Wherever you
May be tonight
Are you near me
I need you to be by
My side

'Cause I never said
Goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said
I love you
Why didn't I just
Tell you
God knows I need
You to know

No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby

Somewhere I know you'll be
With me
Someday in another time
But right now you're gone
You just vanished away
But I'll never leave
You behind

No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby 
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

The kids in girl and boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland
All around the Christmas tree

So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

Santa Claus (is comin' to town)
Santa Claus (is comin' to town)
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
To town 
When I am lost
You shine a light for me and set me free
When I am low
You wash away my tears
And take me through

The loneliness
And emptiness
Through the darkest night
Somehow I survive
Through it all

When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee

If I should fall
Your love is strong enough to life me up
If I'm afraid
You chase away my fears
And take me to

A brighter place
Beyond the rain
And I feel alright
Because you're by my side
Through it all

When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee

You take me through
The loneliness and emptiness
And I feel alright
'Cause you're by my side

Through it all
You tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Just breaks away the clouds surrounding me
And baby all I have I want to give to thee

Want to give you all of my love
Now and forever my love
All I have I want to give to thee 
I've been waiting for someone to come into my life
Who would bring me joy and give me pleasure
I have taken chances on romances once or twice
And I found that in my heart it's you I treasure

You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever

All my life
My love's been waiting for you
All my life
My heart's been waiting too

All my life:

I've been wishing on a star
I've been praying on my knees
I've got some sly and sexy tricks to show you
Most of all I'll give you anything boy that you need
To keep you right here by my side
I know you
I'll show you

You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever

All my life
My love's been waiting for you
All my life
My heart's been waiting too
Don't you know I need you
And adore you
All my life I'll give to only you 
Reflections of your love 
Have come to wither 
I thought I'd done my best to memorize 
A picture fades of you and I together 
I haven't come to terms 
With how we said goodbye 

Did you really care 
Care for me at all 
Did you really care 
Did you care for me at all 

A displaced little girl 
Wept years in silence 
And whispered wishes you'd materialize 
She pressed on night and day 
To keep on living 
And tried to many ways 
To keep her soul alive 

Did you really care 
Care enough for me 
Did you really care 
Did you care at all for me 

If I'm not quite good enough 
Or somehow undeserving of 
A mother's love 

You could have had the decency 
To give me up 
Before you gave me life 

Don't you even care 
Just the slightest bit for me 
Cause I really need to feel you cared 
Even once upon a time for me 
I need to believe, in my heart of hearts, you care for me 
I need to understand 
Why you left me there so helplessly 

Don't you even care 
Care at all for me 

Reflections of your love 
Have come to wither 
I thought I'd done my best to memorize
Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the earth
The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me

He rules the world
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me

Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me 
If you're lonely
And need a friend
And troubles seem like
They never end
Just remember to keep the faith
And love will be there to light the way

Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright

When the shadows are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember you're not alone
And love will be there
To guide you home

Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright

If you just believe in me
I will love you endlessly
Take my hand
Take me into your heart
I'll be there forever baby
I won't let go
I'll never let go

Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
It's alright
It's alright 
I look at you looking at me
Feels like a feeling meant to be
And as your body moves with mine
It's iike I'm lifted out of time

And time again
Patientiy I've waited
For this moment to arrive

After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade

I feel your touch caressing me
This feeling's all l'll ever need
With every kiss from your sweet lips
Lt's like I'm drifting out of time

Alone will tell
If you feel the way I feel
When I look in your eyes

After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled-me closer
After you go
Will you return to love me
After the night becomes the day

Time
And time and time again
So patiently I've waited
For this moment to arrive

After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer
After you go
Baby will you return to love me
After the night becomes the day
After tonight begins to fade 
I really hope when you hear this song
That you're happy with someone new
I found a love I can call my own
And I owe it in part to you

Don't you know that you seem
Just a little crazy?
You had my trust and intimacy
But you threw it away, just threw it away
And, now, it's all in the past
When I think of you, I just laugh
My friends must have thought I was high
To have given so much to someone not worth my time

Funny how, sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do
(Did I do that?)
You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Til your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool

You were so insecure
And your crew was so immature
Conversations, painfully weak
You were much better off when you didn't speak
But, boy, to tell you the truth
It was my illusion of you
Being somehow destined for me
That had me in a daze
But we're not the same, in truth

I really hope when you hear this song
That you know it was meant for you
Though your attention span's not that long
Try to do the best you can do! 
Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered through alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be 
Jesus Jesus
Oh what a wonderful child
Jesus Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life new hope new joy He brings
Won't you listen to the angels sing
Glory glory glory
To the new born King

Jesus Jesus
Oh what a wonderful child
Jesus Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life new hope new joy He brings
Won't you listen to the angels sing
Glory glory glory
To the new born King

He was herald by the angels
Born in a lowly manger
The virgin Mary was His mother
And Joseph was his earthly father
Three wise men came from afar
They were guided by a shining star
To see King Jesus where He lay
In a manger filled with hay

Jesus, Jesus
Oh what a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
Oh new joy He brings
Won't you listen to the angels sing
Glory
To the new born King

Oh Jesus
Jesus
Mary's baby
Lamb of God
Heavenly Child
Jesus
Jesus
I Love Him
Oh Jesus
All Mighty God
King of kings
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Oh, oh, oh, Jesus
Wonderful, wonderful one
Oh, oh
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Son of God
Oh Jesus
Glory...
To the new born King, yeah... 
Friends tell me I am crazy
And that I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
But that's not the way I see it
'Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me

People always talk about reputation
I don't care about the other girls
Just be good to me
Friends are always telling me you're a user
But I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me

And you may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine
Friends seem to always listen
To the bad things that you do
You never do them to me


Just be good to me
Just be good to me in the morning
Just be good to me in the afternoon or evening
Be good to me

I'm not the jealous type
I won't tie you down in the evening
I'll be around
I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
And we'll be together
Be together

Just be good to me
Just be good to me in the morning
Just be good to me in the afternoon or evening
Be good to me

Be nice to me
Be sweet to me
Just be good to me 
Doesn't it ever stay
Must it always fade away
Couldn't love ever be
Something tangible and real
Farewell, fairweather friend
Abandonment returns to taunt me again

I only wanted you to stay
Linger and mean the words you said
Foolishly I romanticized
Someone was saving my life
For the first time
I only wanted you to be there when I
Opened up my eyes

I was caught in your masquerade
Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil
But it just seemed so easy to
Open up myself to you
Once more into the wind
The embers scatter
And the chill settles in

I only wanted you to stay
Linger and mean the words you said
Foolishly I romanticized
Someone was saving my life
For the first time
I only wanted you to be there when I
Opened up my eyes

Oh
I only wanted you to stay
Linger and mean the words you said
Foolishly I romanticized
Someone was saving my life
For the first time
I only wanted you to be
The one to get me through that night

I only wanted you
To be there when I
Opened up my eyes
Oh
Doesn't it ever stay?
I only wanted you to
Stay 
Do you know
How it feels
Lying here without you baby
You could never understand, what's happening to me
So alone
Nothing's real
I just dream about you baby
And forever wonder why you had
To break free

Even though you're not my lover
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again

It's so hard
To believe
I don't have you right beside me
As I long to touch you
But you're out of my reach
And my heart doesn't feel
It's so very cold inside me
Just a shadow of someone that I used to be

Even though you're not my lover
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again

You were the only one (only one)
That I allowed inside my heart
Now I'm just holding on
To something so far gone
Where did I go wrong

Even though you're not my lover
And even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again
Just to hold you once again 
Featuring Usher

The way I feel for you
I can't describe
Lt's almost too intense
To verbalize
Essentially you're all
I'm living for
And basically each day
I need you more and more

Have you even been so enamored baby
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life you see
Is me and my boyfriend
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me
That's how much I love you

Love is yours and mine
Till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend

Don't underestimate the love in me
Lt's obvious these feelings run so deep
I fail and fail for you day after day
Nobody else could ever take your place

You don't gotta waste your time and worry
You don't gotta look for reassurance
'Cause clearly you're the only one that's getting this and
Sugar I don't need nobody else
But you
And honey I ain't letting go too soon
Because 1 can't get enough
Why you asking how much?
It's more than you can handle baby

When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Ok so it's 5 am and
I still can't sleep
I took some medicine
But it's not working
Someone's clinging to me
And it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels
But it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number
Got a different pager
Then last Saturday
Your cousin called to say you're
Tryin' to reach me
Probably because you see that
I'm with someone new

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry baby
Over you and me

Sipping Bailey's Cream
Sy the stereo
Trying to find relief
On the radio
I'm suppressing the tears
But they start to flow

'Cause the next song I hear
Is a song I wrote
When we first got together
Early that September
I can't bear to listen
So I might as well drift
In the kitchen
Pour another glass or two
And try to forget you

You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defences start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelopes me and I lose my self control

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

Imagining that you're taking it slow
And so tenderly
'Till the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Everytime I see your face I go off
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms 
A broken man without a home
Desperate and so alone
A victim of society
No one really wants to see
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just help each other
Isn't there enough to share

There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change

In another land they still believe
Color grants supremacy
I don't understand
How there can be
Regulated bigotry
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we accept each other
Can't we make ourselves aware


And maybe then the future will be a time
Without war, destitution and sorrow
And hungry children
Won't have to die
If we work together today
We'll save tomorrow
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just love each other
Isn't there enough to share

Those days of love are gone
Our time is through
Still I burn on and on
All of my life
Only for you

From now
Until forever
And ever my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one

As long as I shall live
I'll hold you dear
And I will reminisce
Of our love all through the years

From now
Until forever
And ever my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one

If you should ever need me
Unfailingly, I will return to your arms
And unburden your heart
And if you should remember
That we belong together
Never be ashamed
Call my name
Tell me I'm the one you treasure

Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one

Forever
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one
Forever
You will always be the only one... 
Something that you do
Hypnotizes me
Sets my soul at ease
Every time you're near me
I'm in heaven baby

I don't know how you do it
Never felt like this before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love
(More and more and more)

Something that you do
Mesmerizes me
Sets my body free
Every time you touch me
I'm in heaven baby

I don't know how you do it
Never felt so sweet before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love
(More and more and more)

I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feeling the same
I just wanna be around you
Every minute of the day
Oh I'm never gonna let you go

Every time you smile
It captivates my mind
And it lifts me to the sky
Anytime you touch me
I'm in heaven baby
I don't now how you do it
Never felt so sweet before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love


I just want
To be the only one you live for
I just want
To give you all my love
(More and more and more)

I need a lover to give me
The kind of love
That will last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away

I want a lover who knows me
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights
Till the dawn
Why don't you take me away

Dreamlover come rescue me
Take me up take me down
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around
Cause I wanna share forever with you baby

I don't want another pretender
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind

I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just want someone to belong to
Everyday
Of my life ['live' in CD insert - incorrect]
Always
So come and take me away

Dreamlover come rescue me
Take me up take me down
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around
Cause I wanna share forever with you baby 
You and I must make a pack, we must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you, I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there

And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you, I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter, togetherness is all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be there to protect you, with an unselfish love I'll respect you
Just call my name and I'll be there


If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
'Cos if she doesn't, I'll be there

I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there, whenever you need me, I'll be there

One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love)
Underneath the stars

Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy a bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart in you
There in the dark
Underneath the stars
(Young love)

Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was
Drifting drifting drifting drifting

And I was yours
And you were my own
My own baby
As we lay
As we...
Lay underneath the stars (...baby...baby) 
Today a child is born on earth
(Today a child is born on earth)
Today the glory of God shines everywhere
For all the world
Oh Jesus born on this day
He is our light and salvation
Oh Jesus born on this day
He is the King of all nations

Behold the lamb of God has come
(Behold the lamb of God has come)
Behold the Savior is born
Sing of His love to everyone
Oh Jesus born on this day
Heavenly child in a manger
Oh Jesus born on this day
He is our Lord and Savior

Today our hearts rejoice in Him
(Today our hearts rejoice in Him)
Today the light of His birth
Fills us with hope and brings peace on earth
Oh Jesus born on this day
He is our light and salvation
Oh Jesus born on this day
He is the King of all nations

Today a child is born on earth
(Today a child is born on earth)

(He is light, He is love, He is grace
Born on Christmas day)
(He is light, He is love, He is grace
Born on Christmas day)
(He is light, He is love, He is grace
Born on Christmas day...) 
There you are holding her hand
I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right
Don't you know you were my life

Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night I see you in
my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go

Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept
My world is gone


Do you even realize the sorrow
I have inside
Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind

No I just can't get you out of my mind
I never can say goodbye
'Cause every night
I see you in my dreams

You're all I know
I can't let you go
Even though I try
I can't let go
of something I need so badly
You're all I know
I can't let go 
No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving 
But I guess that's just the way 
The story goes 
You always smile but in your eyes 
Your sorrow shows 
Yes it shows 

No I can't forget tomorrow 
When I think of all my sorrow 
When I had you there 
But then I let you go 
And now it's only fair 
That I should let you know 
What you should know 

I can't live 
If living is without you
I can't live 
I can't give anymore 
I can't live 
If living is without you 
I can't give 
I can't give anymore 

Well I can't forget this evening 
Or your face as you were leaving 
But I guess that's just the way 
The story goes 
You always smile but in your eyes 
Your sorrow shows 
Yes it shows 

I can't live 
If living is without you 
I can't live 
I can't give any more 
I can't live 
If living is without you 
I can't give 
I can't give anymore

Lord only knows
Why I love you so
You're a heartless man
I don't understand
Why you gotta be
Why you need to be
So cold

So cold
How can you be
So cold
So cruel to me
Ice cold
Don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside
You're so cold

You play games with my mind
Cheat and lie time after time
And I know you'll never change
But I just can't break away
I don't know why I let you treat me
the way you do
You're just no good for me
I wish I never fell for you


So many times
You keep me waiting around endlessly
You just laugh as I drown in despair
Never a worry, never a care
I don't know why I let you hurt me the
way you do
You've got a spell on me
I'm hopelessly in love with you


Made of stone
Oh you're wicked to the bone
I give you my heart
You tear me apart
You're like a devil
In disguise

Thank you for forgiving
Hurtful things I've done as a child
Adolescent or woman
Thank you for embracing a flaxen-haired baby
Although I'm aware you had doubts
I guess anybody'd have had doubts

Please be at peace father
I'm at peace with you
Bitterness isn't worth cling to
After all the anguish we've all been through

Thank you for the mountains
The lake of the clouds
I'm picturing you and me there right now
As the crystal cascades showered down

Strange to feel that proud, strong man
Grip tightly to my hand
Hard to see the life inside
Wane as the days went by
Trying to preserve each word
He murmured in my ear
Watch part of my life disappear

Father, thanks for reaching out and lovingly
Saying that you've always been proud of me
I needed to feel that so desperately
You're always alive inside of me
Now you're shining like
A sunflower up in the sky
Way up high 
Close to me
Oh I need you close to me
Loving me
Close to you
How can I get close to you
Help me to

Why can't you see
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you
Till the end of time

I think of you
Every moment I go through
Thoughts of you
I dream of you
All I have are so many dreams of you
Won't you please come true

Why can't you see
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
Oh I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you
Till the end of time

Tell me what you need
Let me give you all of me
Without you nothing's real
You're the reason that I feel

Tell me what you need
Let me give you everything
Every moment I'm alive
Until the end of time


I would love you till the end of time 
Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've give you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around


All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing

Let you take me out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I wasn't tryin' to lead you on

Now you bring me home
And tell me goodnight's
Not enough for you
I'm sorry baby
I didn't mean to turn you on

You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
I want a friend
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on

I know you
Expected a one night stand
When I refused
I knew you wouldn't understand

Boy I told you twice
I was only tryin' to be nice
Only tryin' to be nice
Oh
I didn't mean to turn you on
Oh I didn't mean to turn you on

Turn you on

Tell me why should I
Feel guilty cause I won't give
Guilty cause I won't give in
I didn't mean to turn you on

You think that I'm a fool
Cause I wouldn't play by your rules

(I didn't mean to turn you on) 
Won't you talk to me
This is so out of hand
Something's gone wrong
With the life we planned

Won't you look at me
You're avoiding my gaze
And it seems like you've changed
In so many ways

It isn't fair
It sin't right
If it's really gone
Then tell me tonight
If it's over
If it's over
Let me go

Won't you speak to me
I'm just holding on
'Cause baby I really don't need to
wait around
If the feeling is gone


I don't need no apologies
I'm not looking for sympathy
All I'm asking for
Is your honesty
Won't you give it to me
Give it to me now

It isn't fair
It just isn't right
'Cause if is't really gone
You've got to say the word tonight
If it's over
If it's over
Won't you let me know
Baby if it's over
If it's over
Over - let me go 
My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right

My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Oh yes
You will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love
I'd play the fool
For you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
'Cause baby
You mean the world to me
I know I've found in you
My endless love

And love
I'd play the fool
For you
I'm sure
That you know I don't mind
'Cause baby
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love My love, my love
My endless love 
Shattered dreams
Cut through my mind
Tragically our love has died
Memories confine my head
Bitterly I face the end

Trustingly
I gave my self to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies

And you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine for ever
For eternity
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In love

Stranded here
In nothingness
With only tears
And loneliness

Foolishly
I gave my soul to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies


Helplessly
I fell so deep
I was so naive
To let you in
Why did I let you in
To my heart

And you don't remember
Anything you told me
You were mine forever
For eternity
I know you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
Together
How you needed me
How we used to be
In love 
If you only know
What I feel for you
If you only lived for me
The way I live for you
I'd be in heaven
My dreams would come true

'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you

If you were my own
To caress and hold
I would shower you with love
And drown within your soul
Because I live and breathe for you
And I really need to know

That all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you

Everything I do is for you
You are every part of me
And I don't want to face
Another day
Alone
Without our love

'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you 
Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone, you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love

I look into your eyes
You turn the other way
And now I realize
It's all a game you play
I hold you in the night
And wake to find you gone
You're running out of sight
It's so hard holding on
All alone in love


You haunt me in your dreams
I'm calling out your name
I watch you fade away
Your love is not the same
I've figured out your style
To quickly drift apart
You held me for a while
Planned it from the start
All alone in love

Sitting in the dark without you
How am I supposed to make it
Through the night
Slowly fall apart without you
Cry away the hours
Till the morning light 
If I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Surely I would
Hear the distant laughter
Wasn't it you and me
Surviving the night
You're fading out of my sight
Swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing

I was so enraptured
No sensibility
To open my eyes
I misunderstood
Now you're fading faster
It's suddenly hard to see
You're taking the light
Letting the shadows inside
Swiftly


Reaching out into the distance
Searching for spirits of the past
Just a trace of your existence to grasp
And if somehow I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Lord knows I would
But now you're fading faster
Getting so hard to see
Taking the light
Letting the darkness inside
Swiftly

We were as one
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of your indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

I ain't gonna cry
And i won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably, you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart babe
Our love will never end

She was kind of fragile
And she had a lot to grapple with
But, basically, she kept
It all inside

Childlike and effervescent
With a well of pain
The depth of which I could not imagine
If I tried

Never thought that I
Would hear them say
Twister went and threw it all away

She was kind of magical
Her laughter sent you casually
Floating through a moment
Of release

Dear God, it's all so tragic
And I'll never have the chance
To feel the closure
That I ultimately need
No, I never dreamed
That there would come a time
Twister'd go and leave it all behind

Lord, I pray she's found some peace
And her soul's somewhere at ease

Yeah, I'm feeling kind of fragile
And I've got a lot to handle
But I guess this is my way
Of saying goodbye 
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feel like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside


In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside


You know the way to make me
lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

I wonder if you think of me
Somewhere in the shadows of your mind, oo
Although our love could never be
I found I think about you all the time, oo baby

Am I in your fantasies
The way you always wander into mine, oo
Are you longing endlessly
Just like me deep inside, oh baby baby

When the nights are dark and cold
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?
And when you're lying all alone
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?
When you feel the touch of another love
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?
Am I the one you're dreaming of?
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?

I picture you embracing me
We drift away and leave the world behind, baby
But it's only make-believe
Love can be so unkind, oh baby baby baby
I'm so glad to you
I can't believe what I've found
Got yourself together, trying to move to a higher ground
Now what have I been missing
Besides from the fact that you're fine
Into your mind, and all that comes with it
So many feelings to deal with

Where do we go from here
Can we face our fear
Into a love again, and remain friends

I believe I wanna stay
So once again I'll be finding my way
Back to you

That's just what it will be
So won't you ???? right there
And create a future
Build a life that we can share
That's what it's about
So do you mind ????
Now till forever
Somehow I know we'll end up together
I wanna know

I'll be finding my way 
Wait a minute
Before you walk away
Let me finish
I've got a lot to say
Baby, I'm not gonna tolerate
This game that you play
You'll regret it
If you desert me this way
When there's nobody
To dry your eyes
Suddenly you're gonna realize

(Don't you know)
You need me
(Don't you see)
Believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby remember you need me

Honey listen, don't make a big mistake
I'm in your system
You really can't escape
When there's nobody
To hold your hand
Suddenly you're gonna understand


No one understands you like I do
After everything
That we've been through
Baby, you can turn around and leave
But I know that you'll keep
Coming right back to me

Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind

We sailed on together
We've drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me...
Open arms

Living without you living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me...
Open arms 
Baby, don't tell me you miss me, you love me
Don't whisper gently that you can forget me
Tonight tonight cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away don't play that game
Baby I don't want to anymore

Don't you know that love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby

Don't tell me you're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in
How many battles can you win
Oh don't beg for mercy
Tonight tonight cause I can't take any more
Just turn around don't break me down
Baby I don't love you like before

It only fades, it only fades
Baby don't tell me you miss me you love me

I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see that I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
Love takes time
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly


You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do
Inside

You look at me and see the girl
Who lives inside the golden world
But don't believe
That's all there is to see
You'll never know the real me

She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all
That she can never be
She wades in insecurity
And hides herself inside of me

Don't say she takes it all for granted
I'm well aware of all I have
Don't think that I am disenchanted
Please understand

It seems as though I've always been
Somebody outside looking in
Well here I am for all of them to bleed
But they can't take my heart from me
And they can't bring me to my knees
They'll never know the real me 
Lying beside you
This joy is so deep
I reach out and touch you
Tenderly
Looking inside you
My world is complete
I struggled to find you
Now I'm free

Precious love
Burning so deeply
Shining completely
For you

So blessed
Amazingly
Touching you now
Awakens me
You are my heart
My everything
Feeling you now
Is all I need

Adrift in a moment
So sacred and pure
Alive for you only
I am yours
As you touch me so sweetly
And you whisper my name
I feel how you love me
We are the same

Precious one
Don't ever leave me
Forever need me
This way


Stay with me
Beyond the end
I treasure you
You made me whole again

Baby baby baby
What's it gonna be?
Baby baby baby
Is it him or is it me?
Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind baby
Baby baby baby
Can't you stay with me tonight?
Oh baby baby baby
Don't my kisses please you right?
You were so hard to find
The beautiful ones they hurt you
Every time
Pint a perfect picture
Bring to life a vision in one's mind
The beautiful ones
(The beautiful ones)
Always smash the picture
Always every time
If I told you baby
That I was in love with you
Oh Baby, baby, baby
If we got married
Would that be cool?
You make me so confused
The beautiful ones
You always seems to lose 
Who would've believed
That you and me would fall
And land together
And who could've foreseen
In you I'd find the place
I've belonged forever
And if I move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way
I'd given up hope
Losing the faith that love
Could be mine to treasure
And now
Nothing's the same
I found myself reborn
On the day I met you
And if we move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way
Suddenly you are lying
Here with me and the truths
I used to hold have changed
And if I move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way 
O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night
O night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night
O night divine 
Come closer
You seem so far away
There's something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions
When I look in your eyes
Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions if you look in my eyes

Hey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind

Believe me I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer my darling
Feel the love in my eyes

Soft heavenly eyes
Gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And i was rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As i stood there beside myself
I could see you and noone else

When i saw you
I could not breathe i fell so deep
When i saw you when i saw you
I'd never be i'd never be the same... no no..no

Only once in a lifetime
Love rushes in changing you with the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light burst through the dark
Wakening you in time
And i thought it was all untrue
Until there all at once i knew

I can't imagine
Looking in someone else's eyes
What we have surpasses
Even paradise
It's hard to fathom
Reaching for someone else's hand
What we share is magic
Heaven had a plan

Sent from up above
So much love
In my life
I can't get enough
Of your touch-feels so right

Unending passion
Somehow the fire never dies
What we share
Is everlasting
Love without without demise
He made it happen
Placed so much joy into our hands
What we dreamed
We finally captured
Heaven took command

Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night
Holy night
Son of God
Oh love's pure light
Radiant beams from
Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Oh Jesus Lord at Thy birth...

Sleep
Sleep
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Peace
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep in heavenly peace 
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day

To save us all from Satan's power
When we had gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day

To save us all from Satan's power
When we had gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Once I was a prisoner
Lost inside myself
With the world surrounding me
Wandering through the misery
But now I am free...

You gave me a breath of life
Unclouded my eyes
With sweet serenity
Lighting a ray of hope for me...
And now I am free...

Free to live
Free to laugh
Free to soar
Free to shine
Free to give
Free to love
Free enough to fly

Once I was all so alone
Unsteady and cold
But your love rained down upon me
Washing away uncertainty

But now
I am free 
Let you take me out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I wasn't tryin' to lead you on

Now you bring me home
And tell me goodnight's
Not enough for you
I'm sorry baby
I didn't mean to turn you on

You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
I want a friend
I didn't mean to turn you on

I didn't mean to turn you on

I know you
Expected a one night stand
When I refused
I knew you wouldn't understand 
I know there is a rainbow
For me to follow
To get beyond my sorrow
Thunder precedes the sunlight
So I'll be allright
If I can find that
Rainbow's end

I will be allright
If I can find that
Rainbow's
End 
The wind has taken you
You're free finally at peace
So still you lie
Leaving your cares behind

The pain is gone
Gone with the spirit in your eyes
Now you're wandering around
Above us 
Why
Oh why
(Oh why)
Did
Whoohooo
I should have known
That you'd
Right from the start
That you'd
Go and break
Knowing I was
My heart
Knowing I was
So vulnerable
Oh
