Hello, Wembly!

Now there was a time when we used to say
that behind every great man there had to be a great woman

But in these times of change you know that it's no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
Cause there's something we forgot to say to you

Sisters are doin' it for themselves
standing on their own two feet and ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too
Woman to woman, we're singing with you

The inferior sex got a new exterior
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too
everybody take a look around
Can you see, can you see, can you see
There's a woman right next to you

Sisters are doin' it for themselves
standing on their own two feet and ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Now we ain't making stories
No we ain't making plans
Cause a man still loves a woman

And a woman still loves a man
Now there was a time(Now there was a time)
When we used to say(When we used to say)
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman

But in these times of change you know that it's no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
Cause there's something we forgot to say to you

Sisters are doin' it for themselves
standing on their own two feet and ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
There will come a time
I know I'm gonna need
Someone I can trust, someone who'll fight for me
That's the way I love

This is my time to work things out
What I want from this life
There will be someone out there for me
That's the way I love

It doesn't really matter whoever you are
Don't matter where you go
Just make sure you're there to answer when love comes around
Don't be surprised when love knocks at your door

You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breathe in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like oxygen

Even when we're so far apart
I still feel you in my heart
Cos you've given me the greatest gift of all
That's the way I love

The way I love is easy, but could it ever be for me?
This situation seems so insane
It's all about feeling without insecurities
That's the way I love

It doesn't really matter who ever you are
Don't matter where you go
Just make sure you're there to answer when love comes around
Don't be surprised when love knocks at your door

You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breath in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like oxygen
You're in every breath I take

Imagine a life without love
I'd be so afraid
So afraid
Cos the love that we share
Would be hard to replace
Baby hold me and never leave me
This love is my oxygen

Open your heart
Take a deep breath
Stop searching and start believing
Make sure you're there to answer when love comes around
Don't be surprised when true love knocks at your door

You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breath in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like oxygen
You're in every breath I take

Imagine a life without love
I'd be so afraid
Cos the love that we share
Would be hard to replace
Baby hold me and never leave me
This love is my oxygen
You know I don't wanna know don't wanna know about that love thing
Give me what I'm needing you know what I'm dreaming of
Don't wanna know about love thing
Been broken hearted before but that's the last time it happens to me
I keep on giving still you're asking for more
Too much emotion baby why can't you see
I'm not afraid of your love (I'm not afraid of your love)
Why can't you see I've had my share of that
You're what I want boy,
You know you got boy,
You gotta want me,
It's just what I need,
I'm not that easy as a matter of fact,
There's no room for lovin' stop that push and shovin' yeah,
Don't wanna know about that love thing,
Give me what I'm needing you know what I'm dreaming of,

Don't wanna know about that love thing, (here we go, here we go)

Now don't go wasting my time,
You're not the only thing I've got on my mind,
My friends are with me when you ain't been around,
Your precious words and promises ain't bringin' me down,
I've got some living to do, don't assume I'm gonna be with you,
You gotta want boy,
You know you got boy,
You gotta want me,
It's just what I need,
I'm not that easy as a matter of fact,
There's no room for lovin' stop that push and shovin' yeah,
Give me what I'm needing, you know what I'm dreaming of,
Don't wanna know about that love thing,

Stop pushing,
You're rushing,
You're losing my lovin',
I hope it,
I see it,
Just play it,
You feel it,
Gotta be bold, bold and oh so strong,
Get with this and you got it goin' on,
On and on with the girls named Spice.

You wanna get with us then you'd better think twice,
God help the mister, yeah God help the mister,
That comes between me and my sisters,
I'm not afraid of your love,
I'm not afraid of your love,
Why can't you see I've had my share of that,
You're what I want boy,
You know you got boy,
You gotta want me, 
You thought that this was love
But my plan wasn't that for us
I thought that you would understand
I don't want you for my full time man

I like the way you made me feel
That night
It's something that I can't deny
But I've been hurt before
I can take it no more
That's why that's why

A weekend love is all it was
Nothing serious because
We're playing games, we're only young
Get with it, it was just a weekend love

You thought you'd break the rules
You thought that I would be your fool
And nowthat the tables have turned
This is a lesson you didn't wan't
To learn

I like the way you make me feel inside
It's something I just have to try
But I've been hurt before
I can't take it no more
That's why that's why

A weekend love is all it was
Nothing serious because
We're playing games we're only young
Get with it, it was just a weekand love
A weekend love is all it was
Nothing serious because
We're playing games we're only young
Get with it, it was just a weekend love

Don't try to make me believe
That you've never hurt someone
Now that pain has come back to you
You thought the love you had was true
Now you don't know what to do

Everytime I turn around your standing
Right there
I really don't want you and I really
Don't care
I can't think about you no, not forever
What we had was good but there's much
More better
You try to blame me, I put the blame
On you
You play the game baby, I can play the
Game too
You say you want me back, it's a simple
Fact
Darkchild and all my girls got my back
Like that

Love is all it was
Nothing serious because
We're playing games,we're only young
Get with it, it was just a weekend love
A weekend love is all it was
Nothing serious because
We're playing games we're only young
Get with it, it was just a weekend love 
No no no no
No no no no
Listen little child
There will come a day
When you will be able able to say
Never mind the pain all the aggravation
You know there's a better way
For you and me to be
Look for the rainbow in every storm
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me
Goodbye my friend
(I know you're gone you said you're gone but I can still feel you
Here)
It's not the end
(You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it, time will never change it, no no
No no no no
Just a little girl, big imagination
Never letting no one take it away
Went into the world, what a revelation
She found there's a better way for you and me to be
Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby
Goodbye my friend

Love is blind as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless words to me.
Easy lover I need a friend
Road to nowhere twist and turns but will this never end.
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (Pleases me)
But sometimes illusion ain't no revolution That ain't no release for me.
Too much of something is bad enough
But something coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough,
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.

Unwrap yourself from around my finger,
Hold me too tight or left to linger.
Something fine built to last,
Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast.
Yes my dear you know he soothes me ,(Moves me)
There's no complication was no explanation, It's just a groove in me.

Too much of something is bad enough,(Bad enough)
But something coming over me to make me wonder,
Too much of nothing is just as tough,(Just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.

What part of no don't you understand, (Understand, Understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can, boy who thinks he can.

Too much of something is bad enough,
But something coming over me to make me wonder,
Too much of nothing is just as tough,
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.
Too much of something is bad enough,(Bad enough)
But something coming over me to make me wonder,
Too much of nothing is just as tough,(Just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.

Too Much of nothing so why don't we give it a try,
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie.
Too Much of nothing so why don't we give it a try,
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie.

Playing the snake of the ladder, but you're wrong

If you can't dance if you can't dance.
If you can't dance. if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby
If you can't dance if you can't dance
If you can't dance. if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby
Now we got the flavour the bad behaviour
The rhythm the melody the juice for you to savour
Rockin' and vibing somebody is jivin'
You need to take a tip, sort it out,
Get a grip whenever I go out wherever it may be,
There never is a Keanu but a dweeb lookin' at me
But even if I did score he's a loser on the dance floor,
Take a deep breath count 1 2 3.

Even when his eyes met mine
His slamming shoes were out of time,
Can't you just feel the groove
Why don't you move,
It's easy can't you see,
Take my hand and dance with me

If you can't dance, if you can't dance.
If you can't dance. if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance.
If you can't dance. if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this you can't do nothing for me baby.
Hey macho
Te vi el otro dia
Me dio mucha, mucha alegria
Eschucha la musica
Ay, madre mia
Hey chico, tu no tienes nada
Que susto, que sueco, que polla, que tieso
Oh, no me toques
Ay, que pero, feo
Venga, venga, marcha salida
Toma esa musica, me canta deprisa
Cuidado, cuidado, que chico, que loca,
Toma mi ritmo
Me voy contigo
Hey macho te quiero
Quiero un hombre, necesito, si pero no tu nombre 
Treat me left, all night,
Makes me feel good, like you should

Listen up I gotta tell you,
About the ins and outs and goings on,
I wouldn't tell just anybody about the fox I'm chasing,
He's resistant and persistent,
It didn't stop me from homing in,
'Cause I'm choosy not a floozy,
I get my hit and then I run with it,

Last time lover,
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy,
And I know you want to get with me,
Last time lover
Do you wanna be my last time baby,
Could it be your first time maybe

We got up and down to it,
Like the dirty bass in the music,
I got my major chords strummin',
Took some time and then we're really buzzin',
First bite wet my appetite,
Second helping's always better,
Started getting burning hot,
I found my pride not easy,
Slowed it down I said stop.

Last time lover,
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy,
And I know you want to get with me,
Last time lover
Do you wanna be my last time baby,
Could it be your first time maybe

Last time lover, treat me left,
Lovin' under cover, all night,
Last time lover, make me feel good,
Lovin' under cover, like you should,
Last time lover
Last time lover, treat me left,
Lovin' under cover, all night.

Cool sexy, ever ready, someone fine, always steady, gentle hands, dirty mind,
Use your head and don't be blind,
Words of love they don't wash with me,
What's the rush no urgency you see,
Crazy boy, potential lover, first and last lover brother
There ain't no other,
Crazy, sweety, cool but racy, steady ready go, yes!

Last time lover, 
At the party after the show
I see a face I wanna get to know
Wink wink, nudge nudge - tell me do you like the rude this stuff
Show me how you gotta make your move
Boy you know you gotta let ya prove
Wink wink, nudge nudge - Are you man enough?

You got the message, you felt my stare
And now you walking from over there
I ain't that easy, I'll make it hard for you

Ooooo Sugar

If you wanna have some fun
Track me down, and get my number
You could be the one
Something on your mind

I feel the heat you wanna get with me
Wink wink, nudge nudge - tell me do you like the rude this stuff
I love the feeling wanna make it right
Baby I'm gonna keep it up on mind
Wink wink, nudge nudge - are you man enough?

Naivety and childhood left behind deprived of the goodness of mankind,
Past encounters have made her strong, strong enough to carry on and on,

Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies,
Strip you down don't need to care, lights are low exposed and bare

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no-one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked

She knows exactly what to do with men like you,
Inside out in her mind there's no doubt where you're coming from
Mystery will turn you on.

Undress you with her eyes, uncover the truth from the lies,
Strip you down don't need to care, lights are low exposed and bare
Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no-one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked

Hello, its me
I thought you'd understand
Well maybe I should have kept my mouth shut
I keep seeing such a pretty picture
I'd rather be hated than pitied
Maybe I should have left it to your imagination
I just want to be me

This angel's dirty face is sore, holding on to what she had before.
Not sharing secrets with any old fool, now she's gonna keep her cool,
She wants to get naked
She wants to get naked,
Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no-one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she is only naked 
Spice girls, dark child, lets dance
Ooooh oooooh
We could have had it all
But you turned your back

We started with dreams, we started a team
But you weren't as true as you always seem
You promised to love, no matter what
But you turned your back and walked out on me

What made you think that without me
Your life would be much better but now you see
but now you see
But without me your heart can dream
It will never be as good as what you had with me

Tell me why oh why did we end up this way
We tried to make every single day
Tell me why oh why you felt you couldn't stay
We could have been together, but you wanted it this way

Who never thought that I would find out
All of the things that you said about us
Where you're the one who, decided to
Erase all our fantasies

What made you think that without me
Your life would be much better but now you see
But now you see
But without me your heart can dream
It will never be as good as what you had with me

Tell me why oh why did we end up this way
We tried to make up every single day
Tell me why oh why you felt you couldn't stay
We could have been together, but you wanted it this way

Tell me why oh why did we end up this way
We tried to make Every single day
Tell me why oh why you felt you couldn't stay
We could have been together, but you wanted it this way

Now tell me why did you plan all along
To try and use me, and then let go
Now where is the trust we had between us 
Elvis was a coola shaker
Marley Ziggy Melody Maker
She's a Bond babe kick some ass
Doctor no this girl's got class
Charlie's Angels Girls on top
Handbags heels their pistols rock
Baby Love are so glam queen
Sing the blues a love supreme
Sixties Twiggy set the pace
Way back then she had the face
That's all in the past legends built to last
But she's got something new
She's a power girl, in a ninties world,
And she knows just what to do,
Cause the lady is a vamp, she's a vixen not a tramp,

She's a da da da da da da da,
Come on fellas place your bets cause you ain't seen nothing yet,
She's the top of the top she's the best, yes.

Jackie O, we loved her so,
Sorry Mr. President, as far as we know

Norma Jean had a seven year itch,
Some like it hot to a fever pitch, Sandy, Danny,
Summer love, Pink Ladies, T-Birds, the moon above,
That's all in the past, legends built to last,
But she's got something new,
She's a power girl, in a ninties world,
She's a downtown swinging dude,
Cause the lady is a vamp, she's a vixen not a tramp,

So for eternity you will have a part of me
And all I need is for you to stay right here with me

Time goes by but we can stay for eternity I wish

You are the reason that my heart beats
And no I never thought, I would eve fall so deep
But now I see that the love that we share
Is oh so sweet

What if i told you that I believe
That you are my soul, my destiny
What if I was to say
In every way
Deep in my heart is where you'll be


Time goes by but we can stay for eternity I wish

Thats howI feel when you're with me

Time goes by but we can stay for eternity I wish

But i'd like to see you pull a trick on me
You think you're so cool

Everything you say (denying)
Everything you do
So be a fol to yourself forever more (trying)
Any kind of move (tell me)
So what's it gonna prove
You ain't fooling nobody
You ain't fooling nobody
But yourself

I know you're sweet
But I know you don't want to be seen that way
Admit defeat, win or lose
Who cares it's just a game you play
I know you need me
If you stay that way it's never gonna be
You've got your stile
But I know what you really want from me

Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself

Live Forever for the moment
Ever searching for the world

Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved
Has reflections in my mind
Hasta Manana, always be mine
Viva Forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, Like the sun
Live Forever, For the moment
Ever searching, for the world

Everlasting, Like the sun
 
Colours of the world
Spice up your life
Every boy and girl
Spice up your life
Every boy and girl Spice up your life
People of the world
Spice up your life
Aaahh!!!

My skin is cold, transfusion with somebody morose and
Old, drop into fruitless dying
It was tempting and bared, the whoring angel rising
Now burning prayers, my silent time of losing

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

Long for the blur, we cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt, disgusted with my cheapness

Reaching down, staring up (at the forgiver)
