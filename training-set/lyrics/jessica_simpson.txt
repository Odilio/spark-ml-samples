You set my soul at ease 
Chased darkness out of view 
Left your desperate spell on me 
Say you feel it to 
I know you do 
I've got so much more to give 
This can't die, I yearn to live 
Pour yourself all over me 
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees

I wanna love you forever 
And this is all I'm asking of you 
10,000 lifetimes together 
Is that so much for you to do? 
Cuz from the moment that I saw your face 
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace 
I swear I knew. 
I'm gonna love you forever

My mind fails to understand 
What my heart tells me to do 
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you 
and that would do 
I've always been taught to win 
And I never thought I'd fall 
Be at the mercy of a man 
I've never been 
Now I only want to be right where you are.

In my life I've learned that heaven never waits no 
Lets take this now before it's gone like yesterday 
Cuz when I'm with you there's nowhere else 
That I would ever wanna be no 
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you 
Loving me ... I'm gonna love

Every time you'r near baby
I get kinda crazy in my head for you 
I don't know what to do 
And oh baby 
I get kinda shaky when they mention you 
I just lose my cool 
My friends tell me 
Something has come over me 
And I think I know what it is

I think I'm in love 
Boy I think that I'm in love with you 
I'll be doing silly things when it comes to you 
Boy I think that I'm in love with you 
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you

Just the other night baby
I saw you hanging
You were with your crew I was with mine too
You took me by surprise
When you turn and look me in my eyes
Boy you really blow my mind

I don't know what's gotten into me
But, I think I know what it is

I think I'm in love
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doing silly things when it comes to you
In love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doing silly things when it comes to you
In love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you

Something strange has come over me
Got me going out of my mind
Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside

I think I'm in love
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doing silly things when it comes to you
Boy I think I'm in love with you
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doing silly things when it comes to you
Boy I think I'm in love with you
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doing silly things when it comes to you
Boy I think I'm in love with you
I've been telling all my friends what I feel for you

There are times 
I swear I know you're here 
When I forget about my fears 
Feeling you my dear 
Watching over me 
And my hope seeks 
What the future will bring 
When you wrap me in your wings 
And take me:

Where you are 
Where you and I will breathe together 
Once again 
We'll be dancing in the moonlight 
Just like we used to do 
And you'll be smiling back at me 
Only then will I be free 
When I can be 
Where you are

And I can see your face 
Your kiss I still can taste 
Not a memory erased 
Oh, I see your star 
Shining down on me 
And I'd do anything 
If I could just 
Be right there:

Then I will be free 
So take me where you are 
Now baby there were times when selfishly 
I'm wishing that you are here with me 
So I can wipe the tears away from your eyes 
And make you see 
That every night while you are dreaming
I'm here to guard you from a far 
And anytime I feel alone 
I close my eyes and just be there: 
Where you are 
Where you and I can breathe together 
(and we will breathe together baby) 
Once again (oh, we'll be dancing in the moonlight) 
We'll be dancing in the moonlight 
Just like we used to be 
And you'll be smiling back at me 
(only then will I be free) 
Then I will be free 
Baby I still believe 
Oh I've got to believe 
I will touch you that sweet day 
That you take me there Where you are 
I still believe 
Oh I've got to believe 
I will touch you that sweet day 
That you take me there 
Where you are 
Oh where you are 
I've got to believe 
I'll always be waiting here 
That sweet day yeah 
Only wanna be where you are 
I still believe 

It's all about the way you're feeling
Deep in your heart 
When she let you go 
I don't doubt you care 
Believe that 
It tears you apart 
Whatcha didn't know, 
Someday you'll remember 
Why you fell for her 
Why you said goodbye 
Don't let your broken heart keep forever mending 
And miss out on love that is never ending, yeah

This could be your final heartbreak 
I could show you what good love takes 
Never say good bye 
Never make you cry 
Yeah this could be your final heartbreak 
This could be 
Your final heart 
Your final heartbreak

I don't wanna take advantage 
Or maybe I do 
And I know it's true 
That I can help undo the damage 
All of the hurt 
That she did to you 
You need someone you can talk to 
Someone who feels the same 
About everything you do 
And I could be the one to make you forget her 
I wanna be the one to make you feel better - yeah!

I'll let you feel a love so real 
I'll let you know 
Oh, I gotta let you know 
You will forget 
She will regret 
Letting you go 
I will not let you go 
This could be

The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman that I wanna be 
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman in me I see (I see) 
As I look in, look in the mirror I see
Life is really here to be with me, oh 
I can see myself getting stronger everyday
I'm not the same woman I used to be 
So now I tell myself I am thinking strong
I see the beauty lying within my soul 
The face that I see it's the woman in me 
It's the woman that I wanna be 
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman in me I see (I see) 
When I love myself I can do whatever I want
Doesn't matter what you do to me, do to me 
Honest people, there's a possibility 
To tell you my real reality 
The face that I see it's the woman in me 
It's the woman that I wanna be (I wanna be) 
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman in me I see (woman in me baby)
Can you see the woman in me
Do you really wanna see the woman in me
Hahha, let me show you 
Don't underestimate the woman I become 
The woman I am 
So now I tell myself that I'm thinking I'm strong 
And I see the beauty lying within my soul 
The face that I see it's the woman in me 
It's the woman that I wanna be (I wanna be)

Last night I saw you out 
Hanging with another girl 
Tell me what that's all about 
You used to be my world 
6 days and 7 nights 
Since we decided to say goodbye 
But I'm still feeling you 
I can't get you outta my mind 
I tried so hard to fight it 
But I can't let you go 
No way to deny it

And I betcha she don't love you like I do 
And I betcha she's not giving you all that you need 
If you don't remember let me remind you 
No one in the world 
Could ever love you 
Better then I do 
Better then I do

Don't even fool yourself 
She'll never take my place 
Put her up back on the shelf 
She'll never win this race 
Through all the ups and downs 
I was always there for you 
And now you think about 
Somebody else so 
No one could do you better 
But you know you know what 
I'll wait here forever

She'll never take my place 
No one could do the things I do 
I bring the loving outta you 
Deep in your heart you know it's true 
Better believe it 
You know that you should be with me 
I got the loving that ya need 
It's just the way it's gotta be 
Can't ya see yeah 
You know I treated you right 
I know the things that you like 
And this much I know for sure 
That no one in the world 
Could ever love you more

Time when I was down and out 
No loving in my life 
This angel came and brought about 
A meaning of so right 
Took my dark and lonely days into the light 
With his loving ways

He's my wonderful 
Everything a girl could want to love 
And all I need 
Yes he's my wonderful 
He must have been sent from up above 
Just for me

I gotta have him close to me 
Each and every night 
To give me that security 
Of dreaming and delight 
Love has got a grip on me 
Oh so tight 
Hope he never lets go

Cause I don't ever want to be free 
From this love and care that more people will never see 
And at night I pray that I'll have my way 
And your love for eternity

No one could ever do for me 
The things he does cause

A time when I was down and out 
No loving in my life 
This angel came and brought about 
A meaning of so right 
And took my dark and lonely days 
Into the light with his loving ways 
Oh Yeah 
I said he's everything 
All I need la la la la la la... 

Couldn't look me in the eye 
He apologizes 
He didn't make enough to take me out tonight 
I beg him not to worry 
Please don't turn away 
I don't need a world of riches 
I just need a little time with you and

Sweet kisses 
All I really need is 
Sweet kisses 
That's what moves me

His lips are pure emotion 
He smiles because he knows 
How much I love the way he makes me feel inside 
He answers all my wishes 
Who could ask for more 
Doesn't have to say I love you 
All I need he tells me with his

He heals me, he touches me down to my soul 
My hearts beating out of control 
I just need a little time with you

Sweet kisses baby 
It's all I really need from you 
Don't need your money baby 
Just want you time now baby 
Cause that's what moves me honey 
Sweet kisses 

When I see you there I'm so aware 
Of how lucky I am baby 
Cause I don't deserve I don't come close 
To understanding baby 
The logic of your kind of trust 
It amazes me 
That someone like you would care enough 
To just believe

Your faith in me 
It pulls me through 
When there's nothing around 
To hold on to 
When I fall, when I'm weak 
All the strength that I need is your faith baby 
Your faith in me

Even when I fall I get along 
Cause our love is real baby 
It's like salvation to my soul 
Cause that's how it feels baby 
It's a sacred thing that I keep close 
To carry on 
And I know that I will be alright 
And you'll heal it all

You make me feel I could walk on water 
And nothing comes against me 
Safe within your arms

All I need is your faith in me 
Ohh All I need is you faith in me..... 
Ohh Yeah yeah 
All I need, All I need baby 
Is your faith 
Your faith in me

Sometimes I wake up in the dark of night 
And in my mind there's a picture of you 
I know someday this dream will come alive 
So for now your shadow will do 
I've never seen your face 
But I know your in my heart 
Maybe someday some place 
I'll hold you in my arms

I have a gift for you 
Something that I've held on to 
Waiting for your sweet caress 
No ribbon has been untied
From all that I hold inside
And only you will possess 
This heart of innocence

I lay my head down on a pillow of white 
Your in the dark I am cradled in peace 
No thoughts from yesterday to haunt me at night 
No tears to dry, no sad memories 
It isn't hard to hold 
And now I'll safely keep 
The strength that's in my soul 
Until you come to me

Every night I make a wish before I fall asleep 
That destiny will take your hand 
And lead you to me

You Know I don't know what it is 
But everything about you is so irresistible

Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside 
When he makes me weak with desire
I Know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire, I know I meant to say no

But he's irresistible 
Up close and personal 
Now inescapable 
I can hardly breathe, more than just 
Physical deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
And irresistible to me (yeah yeah, I can hardly breathe)

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I cant stop myself from falling (falling)
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game (No)
Cuz when I Feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I'm meant to say no (I meant to say No...)

But He's Irresistible (Irresistible)
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe ( I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical 
Deeper than spiritual (oh oh yeah)
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Baby you know its more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful

I'm not the kind of girl to sit out on sidelines
The kind of girl who doesn't say it straight from her mind
You're gonna know all that I'm feeling on the inside
I ain't into games, I don't wanna waste
Any time and all the energy we could spend
Being together boy forever you're my best friend
Got a little problem that I can't mend
You been taking me for granted you

I don't wanna walk away from what we have, and you know it
I'm not telling you all of this to make you mad
It's not about who's right or wrong
It's not about who's weak or strong
It's about what I need to make this last

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say
A little bit goes a long way
A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way

Don't wanna end up in a tricky situation
So I'm giving you my every indication
We can work it out together stop the tension
Try to understand, baby where I stand
I love you and I'm trying to be gentle
So let me break it down for you and make it simple
I gave my heart and soul to you now it's essential
That you show a little love for me

I don't wanna walk away or let you go, and you know it
I'm not telling you all of this to make you sad
It's not about the tears we cry
It's about how hard we try
To give a little more and see the other side

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say
A little bit goes a long way
A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way

And it hurts me, 'cause I care and I'm telling you why 
I'm unhappy so if you love me
A little bit is not that much to ask to make things right
Oh yeah, oh yeah, a little bit goes a long, long way

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say
A little bit goes a long way
A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way

Eyes like fire - Burn desire
As we dance away into the night

This attraction - Fuels a passion
That's just too strong for us to try and fight

Each moment we're together
I just never want to end
'Cause I could never feel this way again

'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night
I never thought I'd ever realize
A long that feels so close to paradise
Boy I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes

Lips so tender - I surrender
Everything I am is yours alone

When you touch me - All that I see
Is feeling that my heart has never known

You're all I ever dreamed of
you're my every fantasy
Whoever thought on angel could bring heaven here to me

'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night
I never thought I'd ever realize
A long that feels so close to paradise
Boy I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes

You're the one my heart beats for
You're my everything and more
It's a burnin' love I can't seem to ignore
All the things I feel inside
Are too strong for me to hide (baby)
I need you by my side
'Cause I could live forever in your eyes

'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night
I never thought I'd ever realize
A long that feels so close to paradise
Boy I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes

I was counting down minutes.
I was wishin' on the stars.
I was prayin' for a sign,
And tryin' to beat the odds.
I was dreamin' of you,
Love before I saw your face.
And there you were,
Waitin' for that day.
Then you reached through the hurricane,
When you baby you called my name.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope was gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

Must have broken into heaven,
Just to roll back the clouds.
Were you on a mission.
Were you seekin me out.
Was I that one in a million.
Was I that one sacred kiss,
That you couldn't chance,
You just couldn't miss.
then you whispers through the silent tears,
When you swept away all my fears.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope was gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

Standin' in the middle of nowhere,
With your arms wide open and you,
You were the reason when there was no reason.
In my life
You're the reason in my life.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope was gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope was gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

Like the light in the eye of the storm,
Tellin' me not to cry anymore.
Where I watched my whole world fall apart,
Shinin' through like an angel from afar

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope was gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

Once 
Doesn't mean anything to me
Come
Show me the meaning of complete
Where 
Did our love go wrong
Once we were so strong
How can I go on?

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
to get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
how could I know
That you would go
That you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one

Why
Can't I just leave it all behind
I 
Felt passion so bright that I was blind
Then
Something made me weak
Talking in my sleep
Baby, I'm in so deep and you know I believed

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
to get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
how could I know
That you would go
That you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one

Your lips
Your face
Something that time just can't erase
Find my heart
Could break
All over again

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
to get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
how could I know
That you would go
That you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one

You told me that you would always be the only thing that I'd ever need
telling all friends that they were never good enough to be with me
You want me to stay at home 
And like a fool, I did for you
Now I see the game that you played on me
Oooh

You go out with your friends at night
Like it's alright
'Cause you're hot like fire
Other girls call you your cell phone
Boy, you can't help yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
You didn't know she was by best friend, baby
You just played yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
Baby don't try to run your game on me
'Cause it's plain to see that you're
Hot like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire

You said you loved me baby
And never will fall apart
You even told me once that
You suffered from a broken heart
And made plans to share a summer romance
A dream for two
Just me and you
But now I see what you're really about

You go out with your friends at night
Like it's alright
'Cause you're hot like fire
Other girls call you your cell phone
Boy, you can't help yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
You didn't know she was by best friend, baby
You just played yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
Baby don't try to run your game on me
'Cause it's plain to see that you're
Hot like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire

Fire, like fire, like fire 
Fire, like fire, like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire

Oh, tell me who's think I was
Did you think I was your fool?
Maybe you've taken other girls for a ride before
But I got your number
See baby, I can play your game
And you can tell me how it feels
'cause everything you're ever done to me
Can be done right back to you!

[PHONE RINGS] - "Hello"

Baby you thought you could play me
Thought that you could make a little move and fake me
See honey, I don't need to be
Just another quick notch your on your belt, not me
I'll never be a prize on your shelf
A real player, you'll never be.
You need to run your game on someone else instead of me
Look at you now, poor baby
You're so through
So tell me how it feels
Now that someone is playing you

You go out with your friends at night
Like it's alright
'Cause you're hot like fire
Other girls call you your cell phone
Boy, you can't help yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
You didn't know she was by best friend, baby
You just played yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
Baby don't try to run your game on me
'Cause it's plain to see that you're
Hot like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire

I sit alone
Wishing that you were here
I pick up the phone and no one's even there
But I hear your voice
And it sounds so clear
And I'm telling you just how I feel
Wishing that you'd come and make it so real
(Are you just a vision in my mind?)
Have you really right here tonight?
(Are you gonna make everything right?)
Why you standing here in my door
Are you the one that I wished for, yeah

I wished upon a star tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

Now you will mean more than the word to me
If we could be more than a fantasy
I do believe one day that you will be reality
Just you and me
Being everything I knew me could be
(Are you just a vision in my mind?)
Have you walked into my life?
Are you really right here tonight?
(Are you gonna make everything right?)
Standing right here in my door
Are you the one that I wished for?

I wished upon a star tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

I wished upon a star tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

When you're in my thoughts
(I know in my heart)
You were made for me
That's why we have to start
(Making our love so true and...)
Making a love for two
(So make my dreams come true tonight)

I wished upon a star tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

(Are you just a vision in my mind?)
Did you really walk in my life?
Are you really right here tonight?

I wished upon a star tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish i might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

So faithfully
Holding tight to every dream I thought our love would ever be
As the scent of hope slips through my fingers plain for me to see
I can feel now in your eyes the changing way you look at me
Where's the love we knew would last us eternally

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby
Please don't turn your back and just pretend
That your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me
Can we find a way to fall in love again

It's hard for you
When your heart has opened up to feelings that you never knew
Never thinking that you'd doubt our love you don't know what to do
I'd give anything, my heart, my soul if i could pull you through
Just to find again my love we hold so true

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby
Please don't turn your back and just pretend
That your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me
Can we find a way to fall in love again

And as every night goes by
With every lonely tear I cry
It's so clear to me
I need you by my side

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby
Please don't turn your back and just pretend
That your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me
Can we find a way to fall in love again

Can we find a way to fall in love again
Oh baby, I need you to love me for the rest of my life

If we fall in love again
Would you love me for the rest of my life...

You are every part of me
And with every breath I take
Your love will light my way
And for every day I live
The promise that I made
Is I will never let you go babe

I swear I never knew love like this before
And for everything you are
I gotta make you know
For your love

And I'd give anything for your love
'Cause baby I'd never make it alone
And forever I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see yeah
I only live... for your love
When I was running out of faith
You still believed in me
And never let me fall
And the times I lost my way
You're the one who held me up
And brought me through it all

I swear I never saw it like this before
'Cause baby with your love you gave me
The reason to go on
And for your love

And I'd give anything for your love
'Cause baby I'd never make it alone
And forever I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see yeah
I only live... for your love
When I was running out of faith
You still believed in me
And never let me fall
And the times I lost my way
You're the one who held me up
And brought me through it all

And everything I am
And all that I could be
Would mean nothing now
If you're not with me
Shinin' your light on me
When night is closen' in
When I was weak
You were the one who made me strong
you gave me faith to carry on

And I'd give anything for your love
'Cause baby I'd never make it alone
And forever I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see yeah
I only live... for your love
When I was running out of faith
You still believed in me
And never let me fall
And the times I lost my way
You're the one who held me up
And brought me through it all

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever, I do not trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never swear, I do not trust you

I'm tired of sittin' home waiting for the phone to ring
While you're out doing any and everything
And everybody sees how you're playing me
Calling me your girl

But I'm not gonna sit around and take this foolishness
You're acting like you can't see the matters in my head
You better play it cool
Or this game you'll lose
I'm telling you the truth

So don't you try to tell me 
You've been true to me
When I can plainly see
That in your heart you're still a cheat
And I know that you're lovesick
It's not happening
So don't you come to me
Thinking I'll believe 'cause
It won't work for me

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever, I do not trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never swear, I do not trust you

What makes you think I
Would sit here and be fool
If you think that it's true, you don't have a clue
I just could not believe
That you're playing me
Boy, what's wrong with you

Since you're the man
Thinking that you could play the game
I think I have to show you
That you don't mean a thing
I'm letting you go
So if you didn't know
I am in control

So don't you try to tell me 
You've been true to me
When I can plainly see
That in your heart you're still a cheat
And I know that you're lovesick
It's not happening
So don't you come to me
Thinking I'll believe 'cause
It won't work for me

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever, I do not trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never swear, I do not trust you

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever, I do not trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never swear, I do not trust you

Baby did you think that
You could play me
like I would never know
(Could you be so)
Shady
(Now you're gonna see)
You should never spend your
Time with me
'Cause there's no you and me
We can never be

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever, I do not trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never swear, I do not trust you

Why should I feel discouraged
And why should the shadows come
And why should my heart feel so lonely
And long for heaven and home
When Jesus is my portion
My constant friend is He
His eyes in on the sparrow
And I know he watches me

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye in on the sparrow
And I know he watches
And I know he watches
I know he watches me

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye in on the sparrow
And I know he watches
And I know he watches
I know he watches me

I know he watches me

I sit and wait does an angel contemplate my fate and do they know the places
Where we go when we're grey and old
'cos I've been told that salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed thoughts running through my head
And i feel that love is dead I'm loving angels instead

And through it all he offers me protection a lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong and down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me
When I come to call he won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead

When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a one way street I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love and as the feeling grows
He breathes flesh to my bones and when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

The real me is a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart
Wish I could save the world, like I was super girl
The real me used to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I start thinking about it, 
I almost forgot what it was like
To know what it feels like
Cause with you
I can let my hair down 
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you 
With you, with you, with you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me

Cuz I start thinking about it, 
I almost forgot what it was like
To know what love feels right
Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you

Come and take me
Love you save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you

With you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now (Baby as I do now)
Now that I'm with you

Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lovers game 
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning 
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

I will give it all

We've all been down the dusty road trying to see around the bend
In search of something
Lots of faces different places, emptiness had settled in 
And then I saw him

I'm the lover of your soul
Deep inside this man that I know

Vision picture perfect world as you focus in the lens
Fairy tale begins
I'm so happy that I found you
I just wanna break down and cry and laugh and hug and kiss

I'm the lover of your soul
Deep inside the man that I know
I will give it all and let go
Through his eyes I find my way home

He can take me to heaven 
That's why I need him, and I want him
That's no one I'll ever love, no other can touch him
I will promise you with all I am

I'm the lover of your soul
Deep inside this man that I know

I will give it all and let go
Through his eyes I'll find my way home

I will find my way
I will find my way

I will give it all

I'm the lover of your soul
Deep inside this man that I know

I will give it all and let go
(go go go go)
I will give it all and let go

Can you imagine us making love
The way it would feel the first time that we touch
Can you think of it the way I dream of it 
I want you to see it like I'm seeing it
It's a picture of perfection
The vision of you and I

Your lips upon my lips
(can you just picture this)
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin 
That would be the sweetest sin,yeah

All night i lie awake
Cuz' it's too much to take
Dreaming about the love that we could make
All day I think of schemes 
To get you next to me
I want you so bad that i can barley breath
It's a sign of my obsession
That I can't stop thinking 'bout

Your lips upon my lips
(can you just picture this)
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin, yeah

Your lips upon my lips
(Can you envision it)
Temptation I could never resist
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin, yeah

It would feel so good
To be so bad
You don't know how bad 
I want that
I would do anything 
To feel

Your lips upon my lips
(can you just picture this)
Your fingertips on my fingertips.
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin, yeah

Your lips upon my lips
(can you envision it)
Your fingertips on my fingertips
Your skin upon my skin
Would be the sweetest sin, yeah

Remember that blue crystal sky
The sun reflected in your eyes
Kissed me unexpectedly
A moment I just can't forget
We filled the air with promises
Took them up so tenderly
But life never asks you what you want
It's just gonna have its way
Sometimes it doesn't give like it takes

If I never see your face
If wings take you away from me
And tomorrow never happens, baby
If the world comes tumbling down
And crumbles all around us
Fate turns cruel
You're on your knees
So desperate for one truth
Know that I have loved you

Don't think I'll write another letter
Or watch another pink sunset
Without thinking about you
I take a walk along the blue seaside
How will I sleep at night
How will I wipe the tears from your eyes

If I never see your face
If wings take you away from me
And tomorrow never happens, baby
If the world comes tumbling down
And crumbles all around us
Fate turns cruel
You're on your knees
So desperate for one truth
Know that I have loved you

Without a single hesitation
Without thought or reservation
Baby, I'll be waiting
Even if I never see your face
And wings take you away from me
And tomorrow never happens, baby
If the world comes tumbling down
And crumbles all around us
Fate turns cruel
You're on your knees
So desperate for one truth
Know that I have loved you

I have loved you

If I never see your face
If wings take you away from me
With all my heart and all my soul
The world comes tumbling down
And crumbling all around 
I have loved you

If I never see your face
If wings take you away from me
I have loved you

There's a game you wanna play
There's a risk you would like to take
But words can't change what you feel inside
There'll be no going back from here
I'm scared it'll lead to tears
Patience, boy, and I will decide
If your kiss is sweet enough
If I wanna feel your touch
You should know I can read your mind
If the deal is worth the pain
If you just won't die of shame
I am tempted to try

If you taste this fruit forbidden to eat
You can drink this wine from a love so deep
I dance for you
Let you come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

There's a world you wanna know
There's a place you wanna go
Take your time and love will delight
There're wonders everywhere
Their mysteries to share
Be gentle, boy, and it will be alright

If you taste this fruit forbidden to eat
You can drink this wine from a love so deep
I dance for you
Let you come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

If you taste this fruit forbidden to eat
You can drink this wine from a love so deep
I dance for you
Let you come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

You wanna taste it

Oh, if you swear to me

If you taste this fruit forbidden to eat
You can drink this wine from a love so deep
Love so deep
I dance for you
Let you come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

If you taste this fruit forbidden to eat
You can drink this wine from a love so deep
Love so deep
I dance for you
Let you come within
If you swear to me that it ain't no sin

Wanna taste it
Love so deep
I wanna dance for you
I wanna taste it
I wanna taste it
I wanna taste it
I wanna taste it
I wanna taste it

Sometimes the breaks don't go my way
Sometimes there's no good news today
Sometimes it all just hits the wall
Sometimes I think it's all my fault
But I'm not stressing out
You know I could be downtown lost in the crowd
Without even 
One tiny ray of sunlight breaking through the clouds

But I got the sun when I need it
I got the sun
I got the moon
I got someone I can talk to
'Cause I get to everyday see you
I got the sun
I got the moon

Raindrops like ice cubes on the ground
And a sound like people talking
There's a lotta things trying to keep me down
But I better just keep on walking
'Cause I'm not staying here
I'm looking up and my forecast is clear
You wrap me up in blue skies
Whenever you are near

I got the sun when I need it
I got the sun
I got the moon
I got someone I can talk to
'Cause I get to everyday see you
I got the sun
I got the moon

I got my best friend
Best that I ever had
I got a nightlight
Get me through when it gets bad
Feels like angels following on my heels
You are my sunshine

I got the moon
I got someone I can talk to
'Cause I get to everyday see you
Baby, I get to everyday see you
I got the sun
I got the moon
See you
See you
Get to see you
See you
See you
Get to see you

See you
See you
Get to see you
See you
See you
Get to see you
See you
See you
See you
Get to see you

Everyday
See you 
See you
Get to see you

Sometimes it's hard when you're so deep inside
To see all you can lose in a blink of an eye
Dreams could be shattered
You could be gone
How would I survive
Cause you're where I belong
My soul-believer
Without you, I don't know who I would be

Underneath, I can feel you move through me
Inside out, you surround me
I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath
Oh, you're everything I know
So how could I let you go

Sometimes I listen to a voice that isn't mine
I disconnect from everything inside
And I have made choices
And wasted all the days
I could have been with you
Where my heart stayed
I know you've waited faithfully
Blessing our love even stronger

Underneath, I can feel you move through me
Inside out, you surround me
I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath
Oh, you're everything I know
So how could I let you go

And I've been blessed
For every kiss
For every breath
(How could I let you down)
And I've been touched,
By hands I trust
My love is risen

Underneath, I can feel you move through me
Inside out, you surround me
I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath
Oh, you're everything I know
So how could I let you
How could I let you go

I don't need your strength anymore
cause you've made me strong
You may not see the woman in me 
That you dreamed of
Holding me in you arms

All the days that you gave
All the moments you've saved me,
Praying for my life
Sacrificed, just to make me who I am on my own
You don't have to let go

You don't say it
But it's in your eyes
All the fears of good-bye
But I can promise
You'll always have a place, and a way to my heart

All the days that you gave
All the moments you've saved me, 
Praying for my life
Sacrificed, just to make me who I am on my own
You don't have to let go

I can live
Cause you lived for me
And I can love
Because you loved me.

All the days that you gave
All the moments you've saved me,
Praying for my life
Sacrificed, just to make me who I am on my own
You don't have to let go

(Ooh ooh ooh)
You don't have to let go

I keep on
I keep on loving

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Mmm
(I'm gonna keep on loving you)
Mmm
(I'm gonna keep on)
I'm gonna keep on loving you
(Loving you)
Oh
(I'm gonna keep on)

Don't tell me it's time to go
I think my watch is too slow
Please, I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
Baby, what will it hurt
If I stay until nine
And put your soft hands in mine
Boy I think you should know
I'm not letting you go

Oh my
I don't wanna have to say goodnight
Hold tight
I just wanna stay and hold you tight
So right
Feels so right no matter what we do
I'm just gonna keep on loving you

Yeah you're like heaven to hold
And you're the flame when I'm cold
(Boy I think you should know)
Boy I think you should know
I'm not letting you go

Oh my
I don't wanna have to say goodnight
Hold tight
I just wanna stay and hold you tight
So right
It feels so right no matter what we do
I'm just gonna keep on loving you
Oh my
Love me like the rainbow loves the light
Hold tight
Feels me like the raindrops kiss the sky
So right
Feels so right no matter what we do
I'm just gonna keep on loving you

I think I should stay awhile and keep enjoying you
Come close, wrap me in your arms
Say you want me too
Intoxicated by the way you're making me move
I know I'm gonna keep on loving you

Oh
(la, la, la, la, la, la)
(So right)
(la, la, la, la, la, la)

I'm gonna keep on loving you

They see me in a magazine
I'm the one they want to be
Still don't feel I'm good enough
Still don't feel I'm thin enough

I stand up and I'm pushed back down
And every opinion now
It makes me feel inhuman
Givin' in and givin' up

To be worthy
To feel beautiful in this skin
Be beautiful in this skin
Love me for me
Have confidence in this skin
Be confident in this skin

So tell me what is wrong with me
I'm the girl with everything
So why am I not strong enough
I want to be strong enough
To tell you how I really feel
I know my talent is real
So don't tell me
Don't tell me
I have to be 102
I don't have nothing to prove
So don't tell me
Don't tell me

Cause I am worthy
To feel beautiful in this skin
Be beautiful in this skin
Love me for me
Have confidence in this skin
Be confident in this skin
Be real, be real
See the beauty inside this skin
I don't have to hide this skin
I feel, I feel
An awakening in this skin
Stop forsaking me in this skin

I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am
oooohhhhh
To be
Worthy
Be beautiful
Love me 
For me
Cause I am beautiful

To be worthy
To feel beautiful in this skin
Be beautiful in this skin
Love me for me
Have confidence in this skin
Be confident in this skin
Be real, be real
See the beautiful in this skin
Cause I don't want to have to hide it
I feel, I feel
I'm beautiful in this skin
Beautiful in this skin
I'm beautiful
And your beautiful
Beautiful in this skin
I'm beautiful
And you are beautiful
Beautiful in this skin

Way it's gonna
Way it's gonna

Lately I find I'm caught up in these thoughts
How will you come to me
How will we connect these hearts
Are you somewhere near
Hidden like a four-leaf clover
Are you miles away
Are we getting any closer
Are we getting any closer

I already see us moving mountains
I already see us walk in water
I already see the clouds we're flying
Over and under
I can really see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be

I already see us moving mountains
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
I already see us walk in water
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be

Being with you
Is a like a scene from a dream in heaven
I feel you running through
All my senses
Will you taste like rain
Can I breathe you like air
Will I lose myself in your arms somewhere

I already see us moving mountains
I already see us walk in water
I already see the clouds we're flying
Over and under
I can really see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
I think that's just the way it's gonna be

And I know and I know and I know
Love can move a mountain
And I know and I know
It's gonna be even better than I imagined
Putting all my trust in you
Putting all my trust in you
We'll make this dream come true

I can really see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be

I already see us moving mountains
The way it's gonna be
I already see us walk in water
The way it's gonna be
I can really see us having babies
The way it's gonna be
I already see myself falling in love 
Meant to be
I already see us moving mountains
The way it's gonna be 
I already see us walk in water
To me
The way it's gonna be
I can really see us having babies
The way it's gonna be
