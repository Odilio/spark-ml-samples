Longboats have been sighted the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around so be prepared don't run stand your ground

They're coming in from the sea
they've come the enemy
beneath the blazing sun
the battle has to be won
Invaders ... Pillaging
Invaders ... Looting

Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone

They're coming over the hill
they've come to attack
they're coming in for the kill
there's no turning back
Invaders ... Fighting
Invaders ... Marauding

Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen

You'd better scatter and run
the battle's lost and not won
you'd better get away
to fight another day
Invaders ... Raping
Invaders ... Plundering

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of The Damned

He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all
Children of The Damned

Now it's burning his hands he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on ground what did we learn

You're Children of The Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're Children of The Damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of The Damned

I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feeling dead on my feet
Going all the way, I'm natures beast
Do what I want and do as I please

Run - Fight - To breathe - It's tough
Now you see me now you don't
Break the walls I'm coming out

Not a prisoner I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going ...out!

If you kill me it's self defense
And if I kill ya' then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name

Run - Fight - To breathe - It's gonna be tough
Now you see me now you don't
Break the walls I'm coming out

Not a prisoner I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going

I'm not a number I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
Cause' I'll run rings around you

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

If you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it she'll teach you more than you can know

Charlotte can't you get out from all of this madness
Can't you see it only brings you sadness
When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease

Some day when you're reaching the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more

22 the avenue that's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside the red light's burning bright tonight

Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay

Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

22 the avenue that's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside the red light's burning bright tonight

Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please
Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees
Abuse her misuse her she can take all that you've got
Caress her molest her she always does what you want

You're running away don't you know what you're doing
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good don't you know that you're hurting
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags and you're coming with me

"Woe to you, Oh Earth and Sea, for the Devil sends the
beast with wrath, because he knows the time is short...
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the
beast for it is a human number, its number is Six hundred and
sixty six."

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
that night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cos in my dream it's always there the evil face that twists my mind
and brings me to despair

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was this all for real or some kind of hell
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerise me ... can't avoid their eyes
666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take it's course

White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need

We fought him hard we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom's a stab in the back
Women and children the cowards attack

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's a game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills,
run for your lives.
Run to the hills,
run for your lives.

Yeah oh ah!

Run to the hills,
run for your lives.
Run to the hills,
run for your lives.

Run to the hills,
run for your lives.
Run to the hills,
run for your lives.

Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long 'till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive

Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blacked out jail

Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - murders up for sale
Dead men - tell no tales
In Gangland - where jail birds die

In Gangland you tell no tales

Cold as steel the darkness waits its hour will come.
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun.
Mother natures' black revenge on those who wasted her life.
War babies in the garden of Eden,
Shall turn our ashes to ice.

Sunrise has gone, freezing up the fires.
Sunrise has gone, numbing our desires.

Around the world the people stop,
With terror stricken eyes.
A shadow cast upon them all,
To crush them like a fly.
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas,
There's nowhere left to run.
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane.

Sunrise has gone, freezing up the fires.
Sunrise has gone, numbing our desires.

Around the world the nations wait,
For some wise word from their leading light.
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools.
Is this the end, the millions cried,
Clutching their riches as they died.
Those who survive must weather the storm.

Gone are the days when man looked down.
They've taken away his sacred crown.
To be set free, it took so long.
It's not journey's end, it's just begun.

I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of an error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying?
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God, why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Hallowed be Thy name

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
of engines roar in the night,
The mission is near the confident men
are waiting to drop from the sky.

The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare.

Bavarian alps that lay all around
they seem to stare from below,
The enemy lines a long time passed
are lying deep in the snow.

Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare.

They're closing in the fortress is near
it's standing high in the sky,
The cable car's the only way in
it's really impossible to climb.

They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day.

The panicking cries the roaring of guns
are echoing all around the valley,
The mission complete they make to escape
away from the Eagles Nest.

They dared to go where no one would try
they chose to fly where eagles dare.

"O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
Take away our pride."

Just a babe in a black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the Hanged Man - the smile of his lips.

The light of the Blind - you'll see,
The venom tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in a black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.

The light of the Blind - you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

Go

Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring.
It is You.
It is You.

As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill.
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream.
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun.
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly

Fly as high as the sun.

Another Prophet of Disaster
Who says the ship is lost,
Another Prophet of Disaster
Leaving you to count the cost.
Taunting us with Visions,
Afflicting us with fear,
Predicting War for millions,
In the hope that one appears.

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

13 the Beast is Rising,
The Frenchman did surmise,
Through earthquakes and starvation,
The Warlord will arise,
Terror, Death, Destruction,
Pour from the Eastern sands,
But the truth of all predictions,
Is always in your hands.

You're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

They die with their boots on,
Yes they die.

The day, they die with their boots on
The day we die, we die, we die, we die, we die

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cos if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

Die!

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death.

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below.

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan.


Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me.

Oh.....I've never felt so strange
But.....I'm not going insane.

I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do.

Oh.....they drain my strength away
Oh.....they're asking me to stay.

Nightmares.....spirits calling me
Nightmares.....they won't leave me be.

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool.

Now.....I feel they are so near
I.....begin to see them clear

Nightmares.....coming all the time
Nightmares.....Will give me peace of mind.

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too.

Oh.....we'll drown together
It.....will be forever.

Nightmares.....forever calling me
Nightmares.....Now we rest in peace.

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam.

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
to save the power of warmth and light.

Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man.

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.

So they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of life and heat.

Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man.

Well, you killed your first man at 13,
Killer instinct, Animal supreme,
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel

Through earth and water, fire and wind,
You came at last - nothing was the end,
Make a cut by fire and stones,
Take you and your blade and break you both
in two - break you both in two.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on.

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow.

He rules the sand worms and the Fremen
In the land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow.

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
On the land called planet Dune.

Bodywater is your life
And without in you would die
On the desert the planet Dune.

Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis.

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the 'mice'
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'.

He is the Kwizatz Haderach.
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar.

He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars.

The time will come for him
to lay claim his crown,
And then the foe yes
they'll be cut down,
You'll see he'll be the
best that there's been,
Messiah supreme
true leader of men,
And when the time
for judgement's at hand,
Don't fret he's strong
and he'll make a stand,
Against evil the fire
that spreads through the land,
He has the power
to make it all end.

There goes the siren that warns off the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again

Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning out spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press my guns.

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving, goin' again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high.

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
We don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
The shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for our soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The blind men shout,
"Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers."
Napalm screams of human flames
For a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.

The killer's breed or the demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for our soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night

Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night

As a young boy chasing Dragons
with your wooden sword so mighty,
You're St. George or you're David and you always
killed the beast
Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no-one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his Honour.

The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the
fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil man.

He threw down a glove you made the mistake
Of picking it up now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is gone
He'll tear you apart as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance

OH...OH... Fight for the Honour
Fight for the Splendour
Fight for the Pleasure
OH...OH... Fight for the Honour
Fight for the Splendour
Fight for your Life!

Ready to start the duel begins
the best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow

The fighting resumes, a silence looms the
Swordsman move 'gainst each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
a stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile the reaper looks on

OH...OH... Fought for the Honour
Fought for the Splendour
Fought for the Pleasure
OH...OH... Fought for the Honour
Fought for the Splendour
Fought to the Death

Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn

White flags shot to ribbons,
The truce in Black and Burned.
Shellshock in the kitchen.
Tables overturned

Back in the village again
In the village,
I'm back in the village again.

Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way,
In a black hole and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away.

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn.

Back in the village again
In the village,
I'm back in the village again.

No breaks on the inside,
Paper cats and burning barns,
There's fox among the chickens,
And a killer in the hounds.

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn.

Back in the village again
In the village,
I'm back in the village again.

But still we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'M A NAME!

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village again
In the village

I'm back in the village
Back in the village
Back in the village again.

Into the Abyss I'll fall - the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night - watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows -
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris - risen again.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid waste,
And in my last hour,
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.

When I was living this lie - Fear was my Game
People would worship and fall -
Drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me,
For he is a man and a God -
And He will die too.

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned -
Marbled in stone
A Shell of a man God preserved -
For thousand ages,
But open the gates of my hell -
I'll strike from the grave

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid waste,
And in my last hour,
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...

Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares
of the Sea

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and
the Mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name,
hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and ice and
the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and North across the sea
Sailing on and on and North 'till all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me

"Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."

There, calls the mariner
there comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind
in her sails and no tide.

See... onward she comes
Onwards she nears, out of the sun
See... she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

Death and she Life in Death,
they throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then ... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... She, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

"One after one by the star dogged moon,
too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
and I heard nor sigh nor groan,
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
they dropped down one by one."

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the Sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak
and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and
the Mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto Him.

And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins

The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell his tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.

If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Can I tempt you come with me
Be Devil may care fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go would you be scared

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Don't be afraid you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be... honestly
Just let yourself go

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose...
Eternally... let yourself go!

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds!

From the coast of gold, across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but
someone else

I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it 'til it's
gone away
And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my
dying day

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say it's hard to
make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry and throw my
hands up to the sky

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go...

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this
way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be the Angel of Death has come for me
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away

Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait 'til another day

I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying
I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the lights eternal rays
I see a tunnel I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare

Take my hand I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth the path for you is decided

My body tingles I feel so strange
I feel so tired I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

The tough of the track
With the wind
And the rain that's beating down on
Your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more 'til the
Sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread
And every breath you take
Determination
Makes you run never stop
Got to win got to run 'til you drop
Keep the pace hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over half way there
But the miles they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream
Not getting anywhere
It seems so futile

Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at
All costs
I've got to keep going be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on

Run over stiles across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer but do
You want the glory that goes
You reach the final stretch
Ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hope and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and
nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new world

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home
discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

One hundred years have gone and men again
they came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell all that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?

When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?

'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before
Isn't it strange

Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next
It feels pre-arranged

'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend his name was Alexander

At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegian Sea
In 334 B.C.
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men

King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a God amongst mortal men

A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity

Marching on, marching on
The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires,
Seven your desires...

I am he the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name

Moonchild - hear the mandrake scream
Open the seventh seal
Moonchild - You'll be mine soon child
Moonchild - take my hand tonight

I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones I'll find them all
If you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you - you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death

The twins they are exhausted, seven is the night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

One more dies one more lives
One baby cries One mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you youngman
But I see you damned in endless night.

Infinite dreams I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams

Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing I cannot move
Standing rigid a nightmare's statue
What a dream when will it end
And will it transcend?

Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep.

Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

Can't all be coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualists? Well me I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know
The truth?
Oh what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side
You're on
Where would you end in Heaven or
In Hell?

Help me. Help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself even within my dreams

There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again.

Can I play with madness?

Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me ha ha He said:
Can I play with madness?
He said you're blind, too blind to see

Said you're too blind to see

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know
I say you'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said you wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire

Listen to me, said the prophet

Can I play with madness?

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her.
I will call her name out loud.
I would bleed for her.
If I could only see her now.

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge on...
Balancing on a ledge on...
Balancing on a ledge on...
Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge you know ... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on !....

Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.
And I will pray for you.
...Some day I may return.
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn.

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge you know... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on! 

Living on a razor's edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a razor's edge you know ... you know !!

The evil that men do lives on and on! 
The evil !
The evil !
The evil that men do...
The evil !
The evil !
The evil that men do...
Yeah yeah!!

Here they stand brothers them all
All the sons divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one.

Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

Seventh son of a seventh son

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the evil which path will he take
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers before it's too late

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me
Is it so hard to understand
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends

Suffering and pain impending disaster
Souls crying the devil's laughter
Heard the cry of the seventh whistlers
Lucifer smiles looks on and waits

I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate your fortune's in my visions
Heed what I say and you'll see what
What will be
Please listen to me

Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame unto me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment
It stays with me knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed

Purgatory beckons souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs hell awaits

I had their lives in my hands
Their fates their fortunes in my visions
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late.

Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls.
Is this dream or is it now
Is this a vision or normality I see
Before my eyes.

I wonder why I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger
Every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore

There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying.

Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise

There's time to live and time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying...
...and reborn again??

The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time it waits for no man
My future is revealed
Time it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of the prophets I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an end game, one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us?
And look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin does is measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell

Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires.....

Covered in sinners and dripping with gilt
Making you money from slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....

Be quick !
Or be dead !
Be quick !
Or be dead

See... what's ruling all our lives
See... who pulling the strings...
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
So pull yourself stupid and rob yourself blind.

You got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....

Be quick!
Or be dead!
Be quick!
Or be dead!

She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over wiped his kickstart clean
She'd never seen the beast before
But she left there wanting more more more

But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
"I'll take you on ride from here to eternity"

Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
I've made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh.

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the devil's bend
The beast and Charlotte they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line... from here to eternity

Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not fear 'cos I'd rather go now
Trying to visualise the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime ?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come
Thy shall be done... on earth

Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive

But how can we let them go on this way ?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers.

We live our lives in fever
In choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night you can feel so much
In the heat of the night I scream "Don't touch"

I remember a time when we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night... bodies aflame

We live in fever...

I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares till somebody famous dies...

Now we live, in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key - to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority gets it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die...

I'd sail across the ocean
I'd walk a hundred miles
If I could make it to the end
Oh just to see a smile

You see it in their faces
The sadness in their tears
The desperation and the anger
Madness and the fear

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here

Starvation and the hunger
The suffering and the pain
The agonies of all-out war
When will it come again ?

The struggle for the power
A tyrant tries again
Just what the hell is going on ?
When will it ever end ?

You see the full moon float
You watch the red sun rise
We take these things for granted
But somewhere someone's dying

Contaminated waters
Pollution and decay
Just waiting for disease to strike
Oh will we learn someday ?

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, no seed, childhoods end.

Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up till now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads.Long days, of sunrise, to sunset
Sunrise to sunset

Dream on brothers while you can
Dream on sisters I hope you will find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night

Dream on brothers while you can
Dream on sisters I hope you will find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time

Sands are flowing and the lines are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the desperate cry that tears the night

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night

On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I made no sound

Waiting for the mist to cover all around
I carefully picked my time then took the wall

I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about then off again

Being at the wrong place
And at the wrong time
Suspected of a hit that was my crime

I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name

Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack

Every morning onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for a sight of a loaded gun

Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never be the same

But if I ever prove
My innocence some day
I've got to get them all to make them pay

There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry-into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street with you and I
A world of shadows and of rain
He's seen what love is...
He wants to pay you back with guilt...

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of misery

There's prophet in the gutter in the street
He say "You're damned !" - and you believe him...
He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear...
He's felt what love means...
He wants to pay you back with pain

It's only love that holds the key to our hearts... only love...

Now I'm here can you see me
'Cos I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold tell me you can feel me
..........'cos I'm here

Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my dreams... before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand
..........through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those That'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you
..........thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
..........so they say

In a world of confusion
People never say that what they mean
If you want a straight answer go look for one
..........right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
..........looking in ?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power if you want to
..........it's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
..........it does

Are we here for a reason ?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened when we die
..........wouldn't it ?

There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must have lived before
..........don't you ?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an open and shut case.

Extra Sensory Perception
Life After Death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through space and time ?

You know I feel so elated
'Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
..........to fill you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around ...it's me

And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your `friends' might say
We'll meet up again some place some way
..........one day

Lights out - We live in a world of darkness
No doubt - Everything's up for sale
We sleep - All of the world is burning
We pray - To god for better deal
Nothing is sacred - Back then or now
Everything's wasted...
Is that all there is ?
Can I go now ?

Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide

Fight wars - Die in a blaze of glory
Come home - Meat in a plastic sack
Fall down - Better pray to your god for mercy
So kneel - and help the blade cut clean
Nothing is sacred - Back then or now
Everyone's wasted...
Is that all there is ?
Is that it now ?

I live in the black
I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams...

The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool ?

Trying to break away from running with the pack
But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back

You're a weekend warrior when you're one of the crowd
But it's over, just look at you now...

You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out with your mates
It's like a different person goes through those gates
And the game begins, the adrenalin's high
Feel the tension maybe someone will die...

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore

You've gotta get out gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to workout why

It's hard to say why you got involved
Just waiting to be part, just waiting to belong...

Some of the things that you've done you feel so ashamed
After all it's only a game... isn't it ?
And after all the adrenalin's gone
What you gonna do on Monday ?

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you were never like that at all.

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark.

Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light ?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you.

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there ?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense,and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind.

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear, thought you heard
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there.

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone

There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering...at life's disarray

When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies

And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

Without a conscience they destroy
And that's thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds

They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

The rats in the cellar you know who you are...
Or do you?

Watching beginnings of social decay........

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before
But I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling
And guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight ... tonight

I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight ... tonight

I can laugh at the wind
I can howl at the rain
Down in the Canyon
Or out on the plain

I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight ... tonight

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed, and dominance and persecution.
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen, I was never meant to be.

Now I spend my time looking all around,
For a man that's nowhere to be found.
Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around.

'Cause I'm a wrathchild, well I'm a wrathchild.
Yeah I'm a wrathchild. I'm coming to get you, oh yeah.

Oh yeah

Say it doesn't matter ain't nothin' gonna alter the course of my destination.
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind, or I know I'll go crazy.

But now I spend my time looking all around,
For a man thats nowhere to be found.
Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around.

'Cause I'm a wrathchild, well I'm a wrathchild.
Yeah I'm a wrathchild. I'm coming to get you, oh yeah.

Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I just can't live
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to take my body apart

Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I just can't live
Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I'm goin' fast
It's only just a moment
She's turning paranoid
That's not a situation for a nervous boy

Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I just can't live
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, and I can't take any more

Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please, don't you know I just can't live
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, and I can't take any more

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come
Your time will come, your time will come

I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home

Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

A brave new world, in a brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world

Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life....

Pay to kill, die to lose, hunted, hunter which are you
Diablo come again to make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull, one by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate, know which breath will be your last

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Human heart, human mind, intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night, watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe throw the line, everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will iron fist, how could it have come to this?

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how...?
A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace
Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind

You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know that I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of my world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face all this on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what you future will behold
You're a legend you own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Withered hands, withered bodies begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty, the punishment is death for all who live
The punishment is death for all who live

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

The killing fields, the grinding wheels crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives no more disguise, no more second chances
Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late
Before you know the crime it's all too late

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are

When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost

At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings

Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane

At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate

The thin line between love and hate

Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothed in white, standing in the light
Here is the soul of a man

Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man

When the world was virgin
Before the coming of men
Just a solar witness
The beginning of the end
From a world of magma
To a cold rock face
The ascent of madness
And a human race

We are strange believers, all of us
There are stranger truths, immortal lust
We rise from slumber, he calls our name
Recalls our number, abide with pain

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

To God's illusion, which I recall
Was our delusion
Before the fall
The angels come and the angels go
But the lord of light shining below

Eternal darkness beyond the stars
We think our wisdom will get that far
At the master's table, the table's bare
No land of plenty, devastation, despair

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Good day, my name is Necropolis
I am formed of the dead
I am the harvester of the soul metal
And I suck the lives from around my bed
My own two sons I gave them breath
And I filled their living corpses with my bile
What humanity I knew I have long forgotten
For me eternity is nothing
But a short while

Another time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
I will be blacker than the night

One way ticket, no returns
My shooting star—so fast it burns
On the edge that you can't see
Let's shot the moon, you and me
I'm not particular you see
Just a lonesome galaxy

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shootin' plasma from my grave
Event horizon lost in space
Runnin' in a human race

I don't know where, I don't know when
But somehow back there time again
I'm on the edge that you can't see
I'm not particular at night
A single particle of me
You won't be trackin' me by sight

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

We slip into the night

Winter softly falling to the ground
Calmly waiting, don't you hear a sound?

When the world has fallen to the depths below
Where the future's open and the fear has grown

And the path to follow to the great unknown
Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown

In the selfish heart of some
The nightmare's coming
With the spilling blood of others
Now wringing through

Now the cup is spilling over
Wake to news of death
And the prophecy of sages
Destiny is met

To the depths of human mind
The cry is burning
With the mentor's anger
Of the lesson ringing true

And for those who live by and are dying by the sword
They will take their ideals with them
Justify their end

Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone

Where the sons are dying
hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire
begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It'll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It'll be the damnation and end of us all

Where the fools are lying
And the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone

Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It'll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It'll be the damnation and of end of us all

When the world has fallen and we stand alone...

The morals of life and the perils of death
Take the wrong way out, running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night

A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find?

See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine

Laughing sorrow inside your head
Can't get out, just a feeling of dread
I know this burden is a heavy load
A dark mistake, never ending road

The black jack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger, he counts his stash
The joker's wild like an impish child
While Madame Fortune see what's inside

The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search and destroy
The ones below human decoy

I need somebody to save me

Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck, the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one

You hedge your bets, the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line
Between good and bad
And cast the luck, be happy and sad

I need somebody to save me

The red and the black
People don't want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away

The red and the black
Fate and hypocrisy
Burden's a heavy load there is no doubt

The red and the black
All out of luck again
How many chances can anyone have?

The red and the black
Treachery out to win
There in the wrong place and at the wrong time

I need somebody to save me

Look for something that is hard to find
Searching somewhere deep inside your mind
Hope you find just what you're looking for
Heaven's waiting with an open door

If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then
The road to ruin is a long road to hide in
We signed our lives away to have an escape
It's something that will be whatever our fate

There's no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can't take no more lying
This is the last

There's no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Is this the last together? maybe this time now
We stand together and we're holding the line here
There's nothing we can do just sit here and wait
The die is cast that is deciding our fate

There's no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can't take no more lying
This is the last

There's no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Now with nothing to hide, going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Sacrifices buried with kings
Accompany them on a journey with no end
To an afterlife that's rich with fruit of all the Gods
And to face the demons
Of their underworld haunts

The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
A flight to Earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to fulfill man's desire

By power day and night and death he ruled them
The sky and earth and the fires too
Two headed reptile symbol of his reign
Universes of the underworld

A life that's full of all the wealth and riches
Can never last an eternity
After living in a golden paradise
The ultimate sacrifice

Prophecy of sky Gods
The sun and the moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon

Falling of ages
Forest of kings
The search for truth, the book of souls

The rulers of planets and stars
The power of the kings, of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn

They were praying to the Gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown

Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred Gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies

Prophecy of Sky gods
The sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon

Falling of ages
Forest of kings
The lost book of souls, destruction begins

Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
He brought back their lives from the void
Alien invasion brings nothing but death
Mass exodus and plant life destroyed

Domain of the earth to the journey of truth
The underworld caves Mayan slaves

Defeat of the dark lords
The ultimate proof
In the place where the ancestors rule

The book of souls

I see the enemy, I know he can't see me
Combat red in tooth and claw
Ready now for one more score

Took a bullet in my brain
Inside I'm the king of pain
Outside you will fear my name
I ride a blood red triplane

Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong

Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame

Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

I watch you spiral down
Dead before you hit the ground
Bullet got you in the back
Deflection shooting beam attack

I shoot the gunner first
I kill to quench my thirst
I hunt the weakest prey
Live to fly another day

Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong

Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame

Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train

Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong

Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame

Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train

Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame

Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train

Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow
Walking in a dark world that’s been
Kissed with sadness
Without sunlight things are born
To the dead of nightmares
Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness

Listen closely to the raven’s call
Praying hard for our world not to end
Try as might to make sense of it all
Will it be for the penance of men
Follow north for the call of the wild
Look all out for a small wayward child
Lay in fear as the dark raven crows
Look for guidance from the one who knows
He lived on this earth for a time and a half
Playing a tune to the old man’s laugh
The fear that’s inside the men of the oath
In the script of the book that he wrote

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

As the raven again passes by
I can hear all the wake fathers cry
That the first born of all men will die
That their lives will be taken from them
Face the danger a battle of wills
Strength and courage a cure for all ills
We believe in that thou shall not kill
But others are ready to spill
The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I’ll take my last breath

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I’ll take my last breath

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

Into the valley of death fear no evil
We will go forward no matter the cost
Into the valley of death follow me now
Bring me your souls and I’ll make it our last

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter, cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed

But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown

All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There's something that inside has died

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Who motivates the motivator?
Façade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for the camera, all OK
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go

We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we'll never know

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown

Tear of a clown...

Like a man without a home
Watching people come and go
Carry on their daily lives
Without a thought for the ones alone

Cast the dream aside like throwing
A pebble into the ocean tide
And I'm feeling so alone again

Free the angry from their pain
Free the captives from their chains
Cast aside the doubt that
Nothing good can come their way again

Living in a world of lies
No matter how or hard we try
Living life without a dream today

Looking through a mist of truth
That we believe an elusive cloud
The things we find are hard to say now
That we live through day to day
Find it hard to force the reasons
Why we find it hard to die

Now we need to know the truth now
Open our eyes that we can see
So we live and breathe again
Better days for you and me
Can we even hope to deliver this
We are so far away

As one turns against the other
With a brother against brother
Situation like no other it's a picture of despair

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those
Who don't know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time

And we see what's ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no more

To ride the storm, to an empire of the clouds
To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion

Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Gray Lady, giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
"The millionth chance," they laughed, "to take down His Majesty’s craft."
“To India,” they say, “magic carpet float away,” an October fateful day

Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
His majesty’s airship, the r101

She’s the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
Drum roll tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come

The fury yet to come….

In the gathering gloom, the storm rising in the West
The Coxswain stared into the plunging weather glass
We must go now, we must take our chance with fate
We must go now, for a politician, he can’t be late

The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,
But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch
She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
Her fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become
An Achilles yet to come...

Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king, and an airship creed
The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground

Said the Coxswain, “Sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight.”
Said the Captain, “Damn the cargo! We’ll be on our way tonight.”
Groundlings cheered in wonder, as she backed off from the mast
Baptizing them her water, from the ballast fore and aft
Now she slips into our past…

Fighting the wind as it rolls you,
Feeling the diesels that push you along
Watching the Channel below you,
Lower and lower, into the night

Lights are passing below you
Northern France, asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you,
A million to one, that’s what he said

Reaper standing beside her
With his scythe cuts to the bone
Panic to make a decision
Experienced men, asleep in their graves

Her cover is ripped and she’s drowning
Rain is flooding into the hull
Bleeding to death and she’s falling
Lifting gas is draining away

“We’re down lads!” came the cry, bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past
Just ashes at the last…

Here lie their dreams as I stand in the sun
On the ground where they built, and the engines did run
To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?
Oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on

Dreams live on
Dreams live on

Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
The empire of the clouds may rest in peace
And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast
Eight and forty souls, who came to die in France…
