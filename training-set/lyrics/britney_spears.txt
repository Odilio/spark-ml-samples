How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how want it to be 
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now, oh because

My loneliness is killing me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy you got me blinded
Oh pretty baby
There's nothing I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know, oh because

Oh baby, baby how was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something
What can I do!
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is moving
But I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping
It's easy to see
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited
I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one
You will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue
That I'm not wasting
My feelings on you
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited
I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't want to stay
But every time you come too close I move away 
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you

Like the great poets Homer, Agamemnon or even Zeus
We takin' a vibical expedition
This pop ditty we choose
So be calm, don't ring the alarm, you see
'Cause we go on and on
Come, come, come, follow me Britney

Open a soda pop
Watch it fizz and pop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop
Open a soda pop
Bop-shi-bop-shi-bop
The clock is tickin' and we can't stop

We're monster riding to the music tonight
A clever way to get by
The pop-speak flowing like it's fire and ice
So give it a little bly, so...

We have a plan, we have a definite plan
To level the vibes again
Way overdue for a superlative slam
A wicked time to the end, so...

So much time, we losing
Sitting, watching the clock
Turn the temp up, baby
Let's go over the top
No one else will do, I'm waiting for you
So show me what you got, just take a pop shot
And we will never stop
Shi-bop-shi-bop

Jooks we neatly like we've never before
Dubbin' it 'til we drop
We'll flex tonight until they break down the door
The party will never stop, so...

I bet we can party like we never party before
And we keep comin' back for more and more for sure
Just bubble we Britney when we get on the floor, yeah
And we go on and on until the break of dawn

I'm sitting here alone up in my room
And thinking about the times that we've been through oh my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really want to know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on oh my love
'Cause living in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be
I don't want to cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I do
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

I'd do anything, I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever, to be your girl
Just call out my name, and I will be there
Just to show you how much I care

"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?

And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you now, still I miss you somehow

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

"Baby," I said, "please stay
Give our love a chance for one more day"
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about

But you put a dart
Through my dreams through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here

"Never look back," we said
How was I to know, I'd miss you so?

You don't have to say what's on your mind
'Cause I know where you've been
Give it up and leave it all behind
And then let me begin
C'mon over here, let me show how things should be
I will make it all right
Let me make it clear, you can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there

When you need someone you just turn around
And I will be there
When you're feeling low, baby let me know
And I will be there

Won't you let me make it up to youv Now you know where I am
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do
Just to love once again
C'mon over here, let me show how things should be
I will make it all right
Let me make it clear, you can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there

Just take a stand
I'll be here for you, now and forever
Give one more chance
To show you how much I care
I'll be there

When you need someone, just turn around
And I will be there
When you're in sorrow
Just let me know, and I will be there

I promise that you'll be
My one, my only everything
I'll never be untrue
And I promise you back
That for your love
I will do anything
I would give you the stars
I would buy you the moon
Even through the longest of our nights
And even through the darkest days
Our love will find a way

And when the stars are falling, I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading, I'll be waiting
I will still love you

You are my summer breeze
My winter sun, my springtime song
My autumn touch of gold
You are my sky, my rain
The earth in which my love grows strong
The smile in my heart
And the breath in my soul
Even if we find ourselves apart
We will hold our hopes and dreams
Forever in our hearts

Tell me how you feel
I finally know how love feels
Tell me if it's real
My heart tells me it's real
So real

Time may take us apart, that's true
But I will always be there for you
You're in my heart, you'll be in my dreams
No matter how many miles between
I promise you that I won't forget
The day we kissed or the day we met
The sky may fall and the stars may too
But I will still
I will still love you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life, oh yeah 
Walking through time looking for an answer 
How can it be this way 
What have i done, i just can't help but wonder 
How everything could change

'Cause you've turned my world around 
Since you came along, no 
After this love was found 
It seems like we can't go wrong

Deep in my heart I know there's only you 
And right from the start I always knew 
I'll never let go 'cause I love ya so 
Oh-oh, i want you for the rest of my life

Some people search what seems to be a lifetime 
To find a love like this, oh yeah 
And here we are with everything we've wished for 
I've never felt like this

'Cause you've turned my world around 
Since you came along 
After this love was found 
It seems like we can't go wrong

Oh, yeah 
There comes a time in everyone's life 
And I believe it won't happen twice 
Now since i felt the glory of love 
I wish to spend forever and ever with you

Deep in my heart 
Oh, yeah 
Oh-Oh, I want you for the rest of my life 
Oh-Oh, I want you for the rest of my life

Friends say, I'm away
Because I'm down with you every day
They say, "Break away"
I'm missin out on the fun and games
But you smile and the words they tell me
Quickly disappear
You speak and there is no other voice
That I can hear

I spend my days with you
I spend my nights thinkin' about you
I spend my days with you
I spend my nights thinkin' about you

You're so fine, on my mind
And I think about you all the time
Day and night, feels so right
And for us there is no end in sight

Each day that I spend around you
Passes by too fast
Each night that I spend without you
Is longer than the last

You know I can't get enough of you
You know that 24 hours won't ever do

It's been hours seems like days
Since you went away
And all I do is check the screen
To see if you're okay
You don't answer when I phone
Guess you wanna be left alone
So I'm sending you my heart my soul
And this is what I'll say

I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me once more chance
To make it all up to you

E-mail my heart and say our love will never die
I know you're out there and I know that you still care
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever
E-mail my heart

I can see you in my mind
Coming on the line
And opening this letter
That I've sent a hundred times
Here's a picture of us two
I look so good on you
And can't you please forgive me
For the hurt I've put you through

I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you

I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La di da di dee, la di da di da

Wait 'til you have reached the age blah blah
History has turned the page blah blah
But we still wanna hear a brand new thing uh uh
We still need a song to sing uh uh

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on...

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La di da di dee, la di da di da

Love is the first thing last thing on our minds
From tonight until the end of time

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on...

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La di da di dee, la di da di da

We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on...

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La di da di dee, la di da di da

The world keeps turning faster every day
We still wanna dance the night away

And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on...

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Baby, oh

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
All aboard"
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this...?"
"Yeah, yes it is"
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"
"Oh, you shouldn't have"
Oops!...I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby
Oops!...You think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and
I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
To know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
To know it's shining on me every day
When it's warm outside
And the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way
I don't want to wait

Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you
I don't wanna hear my time will come
When it feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
And feeling like I could cry
You dry my eyes

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
On and on and

I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life

Ooh hey, yeah

Hush, just stop
There’s nothing 
you can do or say, baby
I’ve had enough
I’m not your property 
as from today, baby
You might think that 
I won't make it 
on my own
But now I’m…

Stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing 
but my way
My loneliness ain’t 
killing me no more 
I’m stronger

That I ever thought 
that I could be, baby
I used to go with the flow
Didn’t really care ‘bout me
You might think that 
I can’t take it, 
but you’re wrong
‘Cause now I’m…

Come on, now
Oh, yeah

Here I go, 
on my own
I don’t need nobody, 
better off alone
Here I go, 
on my own now
I don’t need nobody, 
not anybody
Here I go, alright,
here I go

Don't go knockin' on my door
Don't go knockin' on my door

Time is up
No more cheat n' lie
No more tears to dry
You and I, we're like so "bye-bye"
Finally
I am over you
Totally unblue
And I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm tellin' you now

Don't go knockin' on my door 
Gotta stay away for sure 
You say you miss me like crazy now 
But I ain't buyin' that 
You better get off my back 
Don't go knockin' on my door

I can see
It's no mystery
It's so clear to me
What we had is all history
It's OK
I can sleep at night
It will be alright
I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you 
Stronger than ever and I
I'm tellin' you now

Don't go knockin' on my door
Don't go knockin' on my door
Don't go knockin' on my door
Do what you want
As long as you don't come back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
And now I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back

I can't get no 
satisfaction 
I can't get no 
satisfaction 
and I try, and I try,
and I try, and I try 
I can't get no, 
I can't get no

When I'm drivin' 
in my car 
And that man 
comes on the radio 
he's tellin' me 
more and more 
About some 
useless information 
Supposed to fire 
my imagination 
I can't get no, 
oh no no no 
Hey hey hey,
that's what I say

I can't get no 
satisfaction 
I can't get no 
girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, 
and I try, and I try 
I can't get no, 
I can't get no

When I'm watchin' 
my TV 
And that girl comes 
on and tells me 
How tight my 
skirt should be 
She can´t tell me 
whow to be
I got my own 
identidy

I can't get no, 
oh no no no

I can´t get no 
Oh satisfaction
Hey hey hey, 
that's what I say

no matter what I do
no matter what i say
every where i go
it seems it´s not Ok

I can´t get no 
satisfaction baby...

My friends say 
you're so into me 
And that you 
need me desperately 
They say you say 
we're so complete

But I need to hear it 
straight from you 
If you want me 
to believe it's true 
I've been waiting for so long it hurts 
I wanna hear you say 
the words, please

Don't, don't let me be 
the last to know 
Don't hold back, just let it go 
I need to hear you say 
You need me all the way 
Oh, if you love me so 
Don't let me be 
the last to know

Your body language 
says so much 
Yeah, I feel it 
in the way you touch 
But til' you say 
the words it's not enough 
C'mon and tell me 
you're in love, please

C'mon baby, 
c'mon darling, ooh yeah 
C'mon, let me be the one 
C'mon now, oh yeah

I need to hear you say 
You love me all the way 
And I don't wanna 
wait another day 
I wanna feel 
the way you feel 
Oh, c'mon

You used to say t
hat I was special 
Everything was right 
But now you think
I'm wearing too much make-up 
That my dress 
is too tight

You got no reasons 
to be jealous 
I've never been untrue 
So does it really 
matter if they're looking 
I'm only looking at you

You should never
try to change me 
I can be nobody else 
And I like the way I am

What you see is 
what you get 
This is me, hey you 
If you want me, 
don't forget 
You should take me 
as I am 
'Cause I can promise you 
Baby, what you see 
is what you get

I know you watch me 
when I'm dancin' 
When I party with 
my friends 
I can feel your eyes 
on my back, baby

I can't have no chains
around me, baby 
can't you see 
I could be anything 
you dream of, 
but I gotta feel free 
You should never
try to change me 
I can be nobody else 
And I like the way I am

You should never 
try to change me 
I can be nobody else 
Believe me, you'll be 
looking for trouble if you hurt me 
I can promise you,
you'll be looking for trouble 
Believe me, 
yeah yeah yeah yeah

This is a story about 
a girl named Lucky…

Early morning, 
she wakes up 
Knock, knock, 
knock on the door 
It's time for makeup, 
perfect smile 
It's you they're all 
waiting for 
They go… 
"Isn't she lovely, 
this Hollywood girl?" 
And they say…

She's so lucky, 
she's a star 
But she cry, cry, 
cries in her lonely 
heart, thinking 
If there's nothing 
missing in my life 
Then why do these 
tears come 
at night

Lost in an image, 
in a dream 
But there's no one there 
to wake her up 
And the world is spinning, 
and she keeps on winning 
But tell me 
what happens when it stops? 
They go… 
"Isn't she lovely, 
this Hollywood girl?" 
And they say…

"Best actress, 
and the winner is…Lucky!" 
"I'm Roger Johnson 
for Pop News standing 
outside the arena 
waiting for Lucky" 
"Oh my god…here she comes!"

Isn't she lucky, 
this Hollywood girl? 
She is so lucky, 
but why does she cry? 
If there's nothing 
missing in her life 
Why do tears 
come at night?

I'm dreaming of 
one kiss from you 
A love long and true 
We'll go on 
and on and…

I don't wanna hear 
that I'm too young 
To know it's love 
that makes me feel this way 
'Cause I don't have 
to feel the heat of the sun 
To know it's shining 
on me every day 
When it's warm 
outside 
And the look in your eyes 
Is longing to show me
the way 
I don't want to wait

Just one kiss from you, 
and suddenly 
I see the road laid out 
in front of me 
You give me strength, 
you give me hope 
And when you hold me in your arms 
You make me whole 
And I don't know
just what I would do 
Without one kiss from you

I don't wanna hear 
my time will come 
When it feels 
like it's already here 
We should learn 
to walk before we run 
But why go anywhere 
when you're so near 
'Cause when I reach out to you 
So sad and confused 
And feeling like I could cry 
You dry my eyes

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you 
A love long and true 
We'll go on and on and… 
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight 
To last all my life 
On and on and…

I'm looking for one kiss goodnight 
To last all my life

Calling out your name
Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win
I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go
I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity
Bit, I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

I should let it out, it's time to let you go
Oh baby, I just want to know

I'm just a girl with a crush on you
Don't care about money
It doesn't give me half the thrill
To the thought of you, honey
So tell me that you want me still
If only I could trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I have it all

But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you
I have been through changes, yeah
But I'm still the girl you used to know
It's made me no different
So tell me why you had to go
Oh baby, I will trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I just have it all

Just the thought of being close to you
It's incomparable
Should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do
Seems like I have it all
Can't make you, make you love me baby
It's my life, what can I do?
Can't make you love me, alright
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

I'm just a girl with a crush on you

When your eyes say it
I love to hear you say that you love me
With words so sweet
And I love the way with just one whisper
You tell me everything
And when you say those words
It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes say it
I love all the ways that you show me
You'll never leave
And the way your kisses, they always convince me
Your feelings run so deep
I love the things you say
And I love the love your touch conveys

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it, say it
And the words that say take my breath away
No song ever sounded so sweet
I love every word that they say to me

But when your eyes say it
That's when I know that it's true
I feel it
I feel the love coming through
I know it
I know that you truly care for me
'Cause it's there to see
When your eyes tell me
I know they're not tellin' lies
They tell me
All that you're feelin' inside
And it sounds so right
When your eyes say it

There's a girl in the mirror 
I wonder who she is 
Sometimes I think I know her 
Sometimes I really wish I did 
There's a story in her eyes 
Lullabies and goodbyes 
When she's looking back at me 
I can tell her heart is broken easily 
'Cause the girl in my mirror 
Is crying out tonight 
And there's nothing I can tell her 
To make her feel alright 
Oh the girl in my mirror 
Is crying 'cause of you 
And I wish there was something 
Something I could do

If I could 
I would tell her 
Not to be afraid 
The pain that she's feeling 
The sense of loneliness will fade 
So dry your tears and rest assured 
Love will find you like before 
When she's looking back at me 
I know nothing really works that easily

I can't believe it's what I see 
That the girl in the mirror 
The girl in the mirror 
Is me!!!

I can't believe what I see no.... 
The girl in my mirror 
The girl in my mirror is me 
Ohh...is me

Dear diary
Today I saw a boy
And I wondered if he noticed me
He took my breath away
Dear diary
I can't get him off my mind
And it scares me
'Cause I've never felt this way
No one in this world
Knows me better than you do
So diary I'll confide in you
Dear diary
Today I saw a boy
As he walked by I thought he smiled at me
And I wondered
Does he know what's in my heart
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe
Should I tell him how I feel
Or would that scare him away
Diary, tell me what to do
Please tell me what to say
Dear diary
One touch of his hand

And I don't wanna be so damn protected
There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do
God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life
You will find out don't worry
How Am I supposed to know what's right?
You just got to do it your way
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I tell 'em what I like
What I won't
What I don't
But every time I do I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize
Overprotected

There must be another way
Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do
God I need some answers

What am I to do with my life
You will find out don't worry
How Am I supposed to know what's right?
You just got to do it your way

Think of all the time that I've wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it face it
Better off alone and I won´t turn back
Thought that I would de lonely
I don't wanna let you back it

Don´t tell me how to feel
Or say that you're for real
My mind's made up
I'm cool without you
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don´t need no man
Says what she can do what she can
Now I life for me
Boy does that make u weep?

Not this time, because I recognize
I've heard it all before, and I-E-I-E-I

Think of times you made me cry
You had me so confused
I´m tired of trying leave dehind this
WHAT'S A GIRL TO DO!

Think of the times you made me sick
I used to think I couldn't hanle it
What you think I'm just another chick?
Lost your grip, Boy you must have tripped
What were you thinkin when you lost my trust
You had it all now your left with nothing
Oh baby, now I know your want my touch
And now your lonely, and you still want me

I used to think 
I had the answers to everything 
But now 
I know 
That life doesn´t always go my way 
Feels like 
I´m caught in the middle 
That´s when I realize

I´m not a girl, not yet a woman 
All I need is time, a moment that is mine 
While 
I´m in between 
I´m not a girl 
There is no need to protect me 
It´s time that 
I Learn to face up to this on my own 
I´ve seen so much more than you know now 
So don´t tell me to shut my eyes
 
but if you look at me closely 
You will see it in my eyes 
This girl will always find her way 
I´m not a girl
I´m not a girl, don´t tell me what to believe 
Not yet a woman
I´m just trying to find the woman in me, yeah 
All I need is timeoh, all 
I need is time 
A moment that is mine
That´s mine 
While 
I´m in between 
I´m not a girl, not yet a woman, no no 
All I need is time, a moment that is mine 
While 
I´m in between 
I´m not a girl, ohh 
Not yet a woman

Two bodies synchronising

We don't need to touch, just

Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast and slow
But have a next guess
But you don't wanna know

I’m not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I’m going to places I can be out of control

And I don’t want to explain tonight
All the things I’ve tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I’ll teach myself to fly

I love myself
It’s not a sin
I can’t control what’s happenin’

‘Cause I just discovered
Imagination’s taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

From the small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately I’ve been noticin’ the beautiful in me
I’m all in my skin and I’m not gonna wait
I’m into myself in the most precious way

And I don’t want to explain tonight
All the things I’ve tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I’ll teach myself to fly

‘Cause I just discovered
Imagination’s taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

There’s a world undefined
And my body is mine
I won’t be left behind
I’m already here

‘Cause I just discovered
Imagination’s taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

‘Cause I just discovered
Imagination’s taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

I said you wanna hook up
But she don’t wanna hook up
Told her, just go
And then she looked and said she wanna hook up
I really wanna hook up
Told her, let’s go

Baby, I can’t believe everything
Your body makes me wanna do
And the way that you move on the floor
Now I think I’m in love with you
Grab my waist
Wanna get with the rhythm and that move you do
Switch my hips on the floor
Baby slow to keep up with you

Back it up now
Bump your own now
Grab my waist now
Work it over
Grab my shoulder
Thinkin’ of ya
Take it lower
To the floor

Hook up, baby
We can drop a little somethin’
Ride it, baby
We can do a little somethin’
You know, baby
Let’s hook up a little somethin’

Baby, I can’t believe everything
That I feel when I dance with you
Feel the small of my back to the breath on my neck
To the move you do
Put your body
Gotta get my body up right next to you
Move the party
Gotta rock the party until they’re over you

Back it up now
Bump your own now
Grab my waist now
Work it over
Grab my shoulder
Thinkin’ of ya
Take it lower
To the floor

Boy, I can’t explain
What you do to me
My whole world has changed
I live in a fantasy
Tonight, I’m in the mood
Please take me by your hand
I wanna get in your groove
So, baby, take me there

Don’t stop
Just get, get on the floor
Butt drops
Hips pop, poppin’ for sure
Who’s got, got it
Get it some more
One time, two time, three time we go

Back it up now
Bump your own now
Grab my waist now
Work it over

Your body’s warm
But you are not
You give a little
Not a lot
You coup your love
Until we kiss
You’re all I want
But not like this
I’m watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

It’s only your shadow
Never yourself
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

Your body gives
But then holds back
The sun is bright
The sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isn’t mine
You left and it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone

It’s only your shadow
Never yourself
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

I cannot tell if you mean what you say
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall
I’m watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

It’s only your shadow
Never yourself
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon

It’s only your shadow

She’s gonna pack her bags
She’s gonna find her way
She’s gonna get right out of this
She don’t want New York
She don’t want L.A.
She’s gonna find that special kiss
She don’t want no sleep
She don’t want no high
Oh, like peaches ‘n’ cream
She’s gonna wish on stars and touch the sky
Ah, you know what I mean

She wants a good time
No need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet
Won’t take a back seat
There’s a brave new girl
And she’s comin’ out tonight

She’s gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.’s changed
She don’t wanna behave
Ain’t it good to be a brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight

So she met this man 
He was kinda rough
He said, girl, whatcha lookin’ for
She said, I don’t know
I go with the flow
He said, let’s get on the floor
He said, you look real cute with your low ride jeans
And your pink little baby tee
Let’s get a room, girl
Come and ride with me

She wants a good time
No need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet
Won’t take a back seat
There’s a brave new girl
And she’s coming out tonight

She’s gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.’s changed 
She don’t wanna behave
Ain’t it good to be a brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it’s alright
A brave new girl tonight

A brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright

Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me?

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song is my sorry

Ohhhh

At night I pray
That soon your face
Will fade away

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
