You bite the tin foil they give you
Your p.n.o.y. mind is entombed
You are amused by your confusion
Staple your face to mine if you're afraid to be alone
I'll mail you razor blades for Christmas
If you're so disgusted then leave the wicked way
You are confused by your amusement
The hypocrite will be the first to see the filth
You want to look like me
(You want to look like)
You want to live like me
(You want to live like)
You want to live like me
(You want to live like)
You want to look like me
(You want to look like)
It's not the same, you don't mean a thing, you're just another stain
It's not the same, you don't mean a thing, you're just another stain
This won't hurt...
You should eat the shit you speak
You know you are what you think
You should eat the shit you speak
You know you are what you think
Don't you try to touch me
You're no different from what you see
Don't you try to touch me
You're just as filthy as filth can be
Like a pinata you crack open
Your candy guts cascade in rainbow
You decay in your own containment
The sweetest insides are all coated with their filth
It's not the same, you don't mean a thing, you're just another stain
It's not the same, you don't mean a thing, you're just another stain
You should eat the shit you speak
You know you are what you think
You should eat the shit you speak
You know you are what you think
Don't you try to touch me
You're no different from what you see
Don't you try to touch me
You're just as filthy as filth can be
And the world spreads its legs.... 
And the world spreads its legs 
For another fuckin' star! 
'Cause I AM the all-american Antichrist. 
I was made in america, 
And america hates ME for what I am. 
I am YOUR shit. 
You should be ashamed of what you have eaten. 
I'm a rock & roll nigger! 
Baby was a black sheep. 
Baby was a whore. 
Baby's gotten big, 
And baby's getting bigger. 
Baby got somethin'. 
Baby want more. 
Baby, baby, baby was a rock & roll nigger. 
How do you like the world around you? 
Do you like what you see? 
How do you like the world around you? 
Ready to be.... 
(Chorus: Outside of society, 
Waiting for me. 
Outside of society 
Is where I wanna be.) 
Baby was a black sheep. 
Baby was a whore. 
Baby got big, 
And baby's getting bigger. 
Baby got a gun, 
Got her finger on the trigger. 
Baby, baby, baby was a rock & roll nigger. 
I'm a rock & roll nigger. 
This is your world in which we grow, 
And we will grow to hate you. 
We will grow to hate you. 
We will grow. 
We will grow. 
We will grow to hate you. 
We will grow. 
We will grow. 
We will grow to hate you. 
1-2-3-4! 
I was lost in the valley of pleasure. 
I was lost in the infinite sea. 
I was lost and begging for pleasure. 
And this world is waiting for me. 
Jimi Hendrix was a nigger. 
Jesus Christ and grandma, too. 
Brian Warner (what a nigger!) 
Nigger, nigger, nigger nigger nigger! 
Yeah! Yeah! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! 
FUCK YOU! 
the ants are in the sugar 
the muscles atrophied 
we're on the other side, the screen is us and we're t.v. 
spread me open, 
sticking to my pointy ribs 
are all your infants in abortion cribs 
I was born into this 
everything turns to shit 
the boy that you loved is the man that you fear 
pray until your number, 
asleep from all your pain, 
your apple has been rotting 
tomorrow's turned up dead 
i have it all and i have no choice but to 
i'll make everyone pay and you will see 
you can kill yourself now 
because you're dead 
in my mind 
the boy that you loved is the monster you fear 
peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark, 
you've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars 
pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear 
pray your life was just a dream 
the cut that never heals 
pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream 
(I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape) 
pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed 
someone had to go this far 
I was born into this 
everything turns to shit 
the boy that you loved is the man that you fear 
peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark, 
you've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars 
pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear 
pray your life was just a dream 
the cut that never heals 
pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream 
the world in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream 
there's no one left for you 

The drugs they say 
Make us feel so hollow 
We love in vain 
Narcissistic and so shallow 
The cops and queers 
To swim you have to swallow 
Hate today 
No love for tomorrow 
We're all stars now in the dope show 
We're all stars now in the dope show 
There's lots of pretty, pretty ones 
Who want to get you high 
But all the pretty, pretty ones 
Will leave you low 
And blow your mind 
We're all stars now in the dope show 
We're all stars now in the dope show 
They love you when you're on all the covers 
When you're not then they love another 
They love you when you're on all the covers 
When you're not then they love another 
The drugs they say 
Are made in California 
We love your face 
We'd really like to sell you 
The cops and queers 
Make good-looking models 
I hate today 
Who will I wake up with tomorrow? 
There's lots of pretty, pretty ones 
Who want to get you high 
But all the pretty, pretty ones 
Will leave you low 
And blow your mind 
They love you when you're on all the covers 
When you're not then they love another 
They love you when you're on all the covers 
When you're not then they love another 
There's lots of pretty, pretty ones 
Who want to get you high 
But all the pretty, pretty ones 
Will leave you low 
And blow your mind 
They'll blow your mind 
We're all stars now in the dope show 
We're all stars now in the dope show 

I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
Norm life baby: 
We're white and oh so hetero and 
Our sex is missionary. 
Norm life baby: 
We're quitters and we're sober 
Our confessions will be televised. 
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall 
Raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all. 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
Norm life baby: 
God is white and unforgiving 
We're piss tested and we're praying. 
Norm life baby: 
I'm just a sample of a soul 
Made to look just like a human being. 
Norm life baby: 
We're rehabbed and we're ready 
For our 15 minutes of shame. 
Norm life baby: 
We're talkshown and we're pointing 
Just like christians at a suicide. 
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall 
Raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all. 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 
There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope 
And we're feeling fine. 
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me 
I don't like the drugs, the drugs the drugs 


You want to look like me
You want to act like me
You've got no sense of your own identity
You can't begin to see
That you and me makes we
That's not what i want to be
So fuck you
Imitation's not a flattery
You can't begin to feel, you can't begin to feel,
You can't begin to feel
I said fuck you
I don't want to know you
I don't want to know
(Chorus: it's about time, i've made up my mind
Get out of my life you motherfucker
It's about time, made up my mind
I'm taking what's mine
You motherfucker)
You are made
From things you steal from me
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel,
Can't begin to feel
So fuck you
You suck my energy, my personality
You steal steal steal from me
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel,
Can't begin to feel
So fuck you
Imitation's not a flattery
So you're a pitiful thief, you're a pitiful thief,
You're a pitiful thief
Fuck you
I don't want to know you, i don't want to know
You are made from things you steal from me
You can't begin to feel, can't begin to feel,
can't begin to feel
Fuck you
If you want to worship me then just worship me
Don't even try to be
You're a fucking thief, you're a fucking thief,
a fucking thief
Fuck you
Imitation's not a flattery
You're a fucking thief
I don't want to know you
Wrench is just a household God 
but I carry mine with pride 
I don't work but I can work with it to split your smile 
Run you down without a twitch, 
your car's just not as big as mine 
Tear the son out of your bitch and 
sprinkle your remains with lime 
I ain't no workin' man, 
I do the best I can, 
I got the devil's hand 
Rollin' sixes 
I am the habit man, 
I use up all I can, I got the slacker's hand 
My afternoon's remote control 
Daydream milk and genocide 
Tranquility with broken knees, silly putty enemies 
Butter knife in your side 
What I got I got for free, middle finger technology 
What's yours is mine, yours is mine, 
told you fucker, yours is mine 
Snake eyes for sissies 
I ain't no workin' man, 
I do the best I can, 
I got the devil's hand 
Rollin' sixes 
I am the habit man, 
I use up all I can, I got the slacker's hand 
I am the pedophlle's dream 
A messianic Peter Pan 
Just a boy, just a boy, just a little fucking boy, 
I can never be a man 
I ain't no workin' man, 
I do the best I can, 
I got the devil's hand 
Rollin' sixes 
I am the habit man, 
I use up all I can, I got the slacker's hand 
I ain't no workin' man, 
I do the best I can, 
I got the devil's hand 
I am the habit man, 
I use up all I can, I got the slacker's hand 
(Oh no, Oh no) 

There was Christ in the metal shell
there was blood on the pavement
The camera will make you god
that's how Jack became sainted

If you die when there's no one watching
and your ratings drop and you're forgotten
if they kill you on their TV
you're a martyr and a lamb of god
nothing's going to change
nothing's going to change the world

There was Lennon and a happy gun
There were words on the pavement
we were looking for the lamb of god
we were looking for Mark David

If you die when there's no one watching
and your ratings drop and you're forgotten
if they kill you on their TV
you're a martyr and a lamb of god

Nothing's going to change the world
nothing's going to change
Nothing's going to change the world
nothing's going to change
the world

it took three days for him to die
the born again could buy the serial rights
lamb of god have mercy on us
lamb of god won't you grant us

Nothing's going to change the world
nothing's going to change
Nothing's going to change the world
nothing's going to change
the world

If you die when there's no one watching
and your ratings drop and you're forgotten
if they kill you on their TV
you're a martyr and a lamb of god
nothing's going to change the world

I can tell you what they say in space 
That our earth is too grey 
But when the spirit is so digital 
The body acts this way 
That world was killing me 
That world was killing me 
Disassociative 
The nervous systems down, 
The nervous systems down 
I know 
The nervous systems down, 
The nervous systems down 
I know 
I can never get out of here 
I don't want to just float in fear 
A dead astronaut in space 
I can never get out of here 
I don't want to just float in fear 
A dead astronaut in space 
Sometimes we walk like 
We were shot through 
Our heads, my love 
We write a song in space 
Like we are already 
Dead and gone 
Your world was killing me 
Your world was killing me 
Disassociative 
Your world was killing me 
Your world was killing me 
Disassociative 
I can never get out of here
I don't want to just float in fear 
A dead astronaut in space 
I can never get out of here 
I don't want to just float in fear 
A dead astronaut in space 
The nervous systems down, 
The nervous systems down, 
The nervous systems down, 
The nervous systems down 
I can never get out of here 
I don't want to just float in fear 
A dead astronaut in space 
I can never get out of here 
I don't want to just float in fear 
A dead astronaut in space 

he lives inside my mouth 
and tells me what to say 
when he turns the trains 
on he makes it go away 
the hands are cracked and dirty and 
the nails are beetle wings 
when he turns the trains on he 
unties all of the strings 
The worm: 'tell me something beautiful, 
tell me something free, 
tell me something beautiful 
and i wish that i could be.' 
(then i got my wings and i never even knew it, 
when i was a worm, thought i couldn't get through ) 
Jack: (not spoken) come, come 
the toys all smell like children 
and scab-knees will obey 
i'll just have to kneel on broomsticks
just to make it go away 
(then i got my wings and i never even knew it, 
when i was a worm, thought i couldn't get through it) 
voice we have not yet heard: 'because today 
is black/because there is no turning back. 
because your lies have watered me/ 
i have become the strongest weed' weed... 
through jack's eyes: 
the taste of metal 
disintegrator 
three holes upon the leather belt 
it's cut and swollen 
and the age is swollen 
boy: ' there's no one here to save ourself.' 
the disintegrator: (to himself) 
this is what you should fear 
you are what you should fear 


They slit our throats 
Like we were flowers 
And our milk has been 
Devoured 
When you want it 
It goes away too fast 
Times you hate it 
It always seems to last 
Just remember when you think 
You're free 
The crack inside your fucking heart is me 
(thought, not spoken): 
I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day 
I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day 
I wish I could sleep 
But I can't lay on my back 
Because there's a knife 
For everyday that I've known you 
When you want it 
It goes away too fast 
Times you hate it 
It always seems to last 
Just remember when you think 
You're free 
The crack inside your fucking heart is me 
(thought, not spoken): 
I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day 
I wanna outrace the speed of pain for another day 
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me 
I would 
Lie with me, die with me, give to me 
I would 
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair always 
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair always 
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me 
I would 
Lie with me, die with me, give to me 
I would 
I hope that we die holding hands 
for always 
I hope that we die holding hands 
for always 
I hope that we die holding hands 


your world is an ashtray 
we burn and coil like cigarettes 
the more you cry your ashes turn to mud 
it's the nature of the leeches, the virgin's 
feeling cheated 
you've only spent a second of your life 
my world is unaffected, there is an exit here 
I say it is and then it's true, 
there is a dream inside a dream, 
I'm wide awake the more I sleep 
you'll understand when I'm dead 
I went to god just to see, and I was looking at me 
saw heaven and hell were lies 
when I'm god everybody dies 
scar/can you feel my power? 
shoot here and the world gets smaller 
scar/scar/can you feel my power? 
one shot and the world gets smaller 
let's jump upon the sharp swords 
and cut away our smiles 
without the threat of death 
there's no reason to live at all 
my world is unaffected, there is an exit here 
I say it is and then it's true, 
there is a dream inside a dream, 
I'm wide awake the more I sleep 
you'll understand when I'm dead 
'each thing i show you is a piece of my death'
shoot shoot shoot motherfucker 
no salvation, no forgiveness 
'this is beyond your experience' 
forgiveness... 


Am I sorry your sky went black, 
put your knives in babies backs?
Am I sorry you killed the Kennedy's and Huxley too?

But I'm sorry Shakespeare
was your scapegoat
and your apples sticking into my throat
Sorry your Sunday smiles are rusty nails
and your crucifixion commercials failed
but I'm just a pitiful anonymous

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
we all just sing their song

Am I sorry to be alive
putting my face in the beehive?
Am I sorry for Booth and Oswald, pinks and cocaine too?

I'm sorry you never check 
the bag in my head for a bomb
and my halo was a needle hole
I'm sorry I saw a priest being beaten
and I made a wish
but I'm just a pitiful anonymous

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
we all just sing their song
we all just sing their song

'the valley of death we are free
your father's your prison you see'

And I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
we all just sing their song

you're just a copy of an imitation


Goddamn your righteous hand 
I eat innocent meat 
The housewife I will beat 
The prolife I will kill 
What you don't do I will 
I bash myself to sleep 
What you sow I will reap 
I scar myself you see 
I wish I wasn't me 
I am the little stick 
You stir me into shit 
I hate therefore I am 
Goddamn your rightous hand 
Goddamn, goddamn Goddamn, goddamn 
Pseudo-morals work real well 
On the talk shows for the weak 
But your selective judgements 
And goodguy badges 
Don't mean a fuck to me 
I throw a little fit I slit my teenage wrist 
The most that I can learn 
Is in records that you burn 
Get your gunn, get your gunn get your gunn, get your gunn 
Pseudo-morals work real well 
On the talk shows for the weak 
But your selective judgements 
And goodguy badges 
Don't mean a fuck to me 
I am the VHS 
Record me with your fist 
You want me to save the world I'm just a little girl 
Pseudo-morals work real well 
On the talk shows for the weak 
But your selective judgements 
And goodguy badges 
Don't mean a fuck to me 
Get your gunn, get your gunn Get your gunn, get your gunn... 
Get! 

Guilt is a snake we beat with a rake 
To grow in our kitchen in the pies we bake 
Feed it to us to squirm in our bellies 
Twisting our guts make our spines to jelly 
Stay, don't want to go now 
Drove the children from their chores 
Handcrafted housewives into whores 
Fear of the beast is calling it near 
Creating what we're hating, it's only fear that is here 
Stay, don't want to go now 
Come into our home, won't you stay? 
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic 
Come into our home, won't you stay? 
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic 
I'm only as deep as the self that I dig 
I'm only as sick as the stick in the pig 
Thin and so white, thin and so white 
Daddy tells the daughter 
While mommy's sleeping at night 
To wash away sin you must take off your skin
The righteous father wears the yellowest grin 
Don't wanna go now 
Stay, don't wanna go now, stay, don't wanna go now 
Come into our home, won't you stay? 
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic 


this is for the people, they want you
this is for the people, they want you
getting high on violence, baby

President Dead is clueless
and he's caught in a headlight, police-stated god
and his skull is stained glass

incubated and jet set
the bitter thinkers buy their tickets
to go find god like a piggy in a fair

and we don't want to live forever
and we know that suffering is so much better

this is for the people, they want you
this is for the people, they want you
getting high on violence, baby

give the bills time to work
we all could be martyred in the 
winter of our discontent

(getting high on violence, baby)

every night we are nailed into place and
every night we just can't seem to
ever remember the reason why

(getting high on violence, baby)

and we don't want to live forever
and we know that suffering is so much better

this is for the people, they want you
this is for the people, they want you
getting high on violence, baby

and we don't want to live forever
and we know that suffering is so much better


and I'm a black rainbow
and I'm an ape of god
I got a face that's made for doing violence upon
I'm a teen distortion
survived abortion
a rebel from the waist down

I wanna thank you mom 
I wanna thank you dad
for bringing this fucking world
to a bitter end
I never really hated a one true god
but the god of the people I hated

you said you wanted evolution
the ape was a great big hit
you say you want a revolution, man
and I say that you're full of shit

we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable

we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable teens
we're disposable

you said you wanted evolution
the ape was a great big hit
you say you want a revolution, man
and I say that you're full of shit

The more that you fear us
the bigger we get
the more that you fear us
the bigger we get
and don't be surprised, don't be surprised
don't be surprised when we destroy all of it

(CHORUS) 

a) EDEN EYE

My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
I didn't know what love was on that day
my heart's a tiny bloodclot
I picked at it
it never heals it never goes away

I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die

This was never my world 
you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world
you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

I would have told her then
she was the only thing
that I could love in this dying world
but the simple word 'love' itself
already died and went away

This was never my world 
you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world
you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die

Her heart's bloodstained egg
we didn't handle with care
it's broken and bleeding
and we can never repair 

Do you or don't you want this to be your song?
It doesn't take a rebel to sing along. 
This art is weak
in its pretty frame
and I am a monkey with
a misspelled name
'I'll put down you disco
and take you heart away.
I'll put down you disco
and take your heart away'
I am born again

I'm someone else
I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else
I'm someone new 
I'm someone stupid just like you

do you or don't you want to take this hit?
Does it make you feel like you're a part of 'it.'
'I'll put down you disco
and take you heart away.
I'll put down you disco
and take your heart away'
I am born again

I'm someone else
I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid just like you
I'm someone else
I'm someone new 
I'm someone stupid just like you

the valley of the dolls is
the valley of the dead
the valley of the dolls is 
the valley of the dead

I am born again

we're on a bullet
and we're headed straight into god
even he'd like to end it too
we take a pill, get a face
buy our ticket
and we hope that heaven's true
I saw a cop beat a priest on the TV
and they know they killed our heroes too

We sing the death song kids
because we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
and we want to be just like you

Let's sing the death song kids

we light a candle on an earth
we made into hell
and pretend that we're in heaven
each time we do we get
the blind man's ticket
and we know that nothing's true
I saw priest kill a cop on the TV
and I know now they're our heroes too

We sing the death song kids
because we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
and we want to be just like you

we write our prayers on a little bomb
kiss it on the face and send it to god

We were the world
but we've got no future
and we want to be just like you
we want to be just like you.


I'm as fake as a wedding cake 
And I'm vague and I know that I'm 
Homopolitan 
Pitifully predictable 
Correctly political 
I'm the new, I'm the new, new model 
I've got nothing inside 
Better in the head and in bed 
At the office 
I can suck it and smile 
New 
New 
New model 
I can choke and diet on coke 
I'm spun and I know 
That I'm stoned and rolling 
Lifelike and poseable 
Hopeless and disposable 
I'm the new, I'm the new, new model 
I've got nothing inside 
Better in the head and in bed 
At the office 
I can suck it and smile 
New 
New 
New model 
Pitifully predictable 
Correctly political 
Don't let them know how far you go 
Or that you use your lovers 
Oh look, you're like a VCR 
Stick something in to know 
Just who you are 
I'm the new, I'm the new, new model 
I've got nothing inside 
Better in the head and in bed 
At the office 
I can suck it and smile 
New 
New 
New model 

They want to sell it out
but it up
dumb it down
a good god is hard to find
I'll join the crowd that
wants to see me dead
right now I feel I belong
for the first time

multiply your death
divide by sex
add up the violence and
what do you get?
We are all just stars and we're waiting
we are all just scarred and we're hating
we are all just stars on your burning flag

you can point your gun at me
and hope it will go away
if god was alive,
he would hate you anyway

my right wing is flapping
the left one is gray
let's hear it for the kids but
nothing they say
they gyrate and G-rate
on Election Day
we got out ABC's and our F U C K

multiply your death
divide by sex
add up the violence and 
what do you get?
We are all just stars and we're waiting
we are all just scarred and we're hating
we are all just stars on your burning flag

you can point your gun at me
and hope it will go away
but if god was alive, 
he would hate you anyway 

Nothing suffocates you more than 
the passing of everyday human events
Isolation is the oxygen mask you make 
your children breath into survive

But I'm not a slave to a god 
that doesn't exist
But I'm not a slave to world 
that doesn't give a shit

And when we were good 
you just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
we're going to scar your minds

fight, fight, fight, fight

You'll never grow up to be a big-
rock-star-celebrated-victim-of-your-fame
They'll just cut our wrists like
cheap coupons and say that death
was on sale today

And when we were good
you just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
we're scar your minds

But I'm not a slave to a god 
that doesn't exist
But I'm not a slave to world 
that doesn't give a shit

the death of one is a tragedy
the death of one is a tragedy
the death of one is a tragedy
but death of a million is just a statistic

fight, fight, fight, fight

I peek into the hole, I struggle for control 
The children love the show, 
but they fail to see the anguish in my eyes 
Fail to see the anguish in my eyes 
I scratch around the brim, I let my mind give in 
The crowd begins to grin, 
but they seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes 
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes, it's no surprise 
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic 
My big top tricks will always make you happy, 
but we all know the hat is wearing me 
My bag is in the hat, it's filled with this and that 
My vision's getting fat, the rabbit's just a monkey in disguise 
Stars and pills and needles dance before our eyes 
They will bite the hand if it is slower than 
the quickness of their scrutinizing eyes 
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic 
My big top tricks will always make you happy, 
but we all know the hat is wearing me 
Chicanery will always make you happy, 
but we all know the hat is wearing me 
I had a little monkey 
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread 
Along came a choo-choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo 
And now my monkey's dead 
At least he looks that way, but then again don't we all 
(what I make is what I am, I can't be forever) 
I had a little a monkey I sent him to the country and I fed him on
gingerbread 
Along came a choo-choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo 
And now my monkey's dead 
Poor little monkey 
'Make you...break you...make you...break you...lookout' 
(what I make is what I am, I can't live forever) 
We are our own wicked gods 
With little g's and big dicks 
Sadistic and constantly inflicting a slow demise 
I had a little a monkey I sent him to the country and I fed him on
gingerbread 
Along came a choo-choo, knocked my monkey coo-coo 
And now my monkey's dead 
The primate's scream of consonance is a reflection 
Of his own mind's dissonance 

I peek into the hole, i struggle for control
The children love the show, but they fail to see the anguish in my eyes
Fail to see the anguish in my eyes
I scratch around the brim, i let my mind give in
The crowd begins to grin, but they seem to scream when
Darkness fills my eyes
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes, it's no surprise
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy, but we all know
The hat is wearing me
My bag is in the hat, it's filled with this and that
My vision's getting fat, the rabbit's just a chicken in disguise
Stars and pills and needles dance before our eyes
They will bite the hand if ti is slower than the quickness of thier
Scrutinizing eyes
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy, but we all know
The hat is wearing me
Chicanery will always make you happy, but we all know the hat
Is wearing me
I peek into the hole, i struggle for control
The children love the show, but they fail to see the anguish in my eyes
Fail to see the anguish in my eyes
I scratch around the brim, i let my mind give in
The crowd begins to grin, but they seem to scream when
Darkness fills my eyes
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes, it's no surprise
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy, but we all know
The hat is wearing me
My bag is in the hat, it's filled with this and that
My vision's getting fat, the rabbit's just a monkey in disguise
Stars and pills and needles dance before our eyes
They will bite the hand if ti is slower than the quickness of thier
Scrutinizing eyes
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy, but we all know
The hat is wearing me
Chicanery will always make you happy, but we all know the hat
Is wearing me
In space the stars are no nearer 
They just glitter like a morgue 
And I dreamed I was a spaceman 
Burned like a moth in a flame 
And our world was so fucking gone
But I'm not attached to your world 
Nothing heals and nothing grows 

Because it's a great big white world 
And we are drained of our colors 
We used to love ourselves, 
We used to love one another 
All my stitches itch 
My prescription's low, I wish you 
Were Queen 
Just for today 
In a world so white what else could I say? 

And hell was so cold 
All the vases are so broken 
And the roses tear our hands all open 
Mother Mary miscarry 
But we pray just like insects 
The world is so ugly now 
Because it's a great big white world 
And we are drained of our colors 
We used to love ourselves, 
We used to love one another 
All my stitches itch 
My prescription's low, I wish you 
Were Queen 
Just for today 
In a world so white what else could I say? 


All simple monkeys with alien babies 
Amphetamines for boys 
And crucifixes for ladies 
Sampled and soulless 
Worldwide and real webbed 
You sell all the living 
For more safer dead 
Anything to belong 
Anything to belong 
Rock is deader than dead 
Shock is all in your head 
Your sex and your dope is all the we're fed 
So fuck all your protests and 
Put them bed 
God is the tv 
1,000 mothers are praying for it 
We're so full of hope 
And so full of shit 
Build a new god 
To medicate and to ape 
Sell us ersatz 
Dressed up and real fake 
Anything to belong 
Anything to belong 
Rock is deader than dead 
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all the we're fed 
So fuck all your protests and 
Put them bed 
God is the tv 
Rock is deader than dead 
Shock is all in your head 
Your sex and your dope is all the we're fed 
So fuck all your protests and 
Put them bed 


I'll spread me open, stuck to my ribs
Are all your infants in abortion cribs
You run like roaches, and you try to die
I know your poison, in our space we'll lie
To an obscene god we will dance and spit
The skin is thin, in our beds we sit
We take off our rings and we kneel
Our scabbed knees are so slow to heal
Stretch a little boy hole
For looking-glass people
I don't want to be me
I don't want to fear, no
Momma's got a scarecrow
Got to let the corn grow
A man can't always reap what he sows

(Cut, cut, cut in pantomime, mime, mime
I'll be your devil if you'll admit you're mine)

Leave yourself to be ultra-here
The chill of fall is always crawling near
Spiders in the flowers
Never know their smell
The barbers here know secrets
They will never tell

(Cut, cut, cut in pantomime, mime, mime
I'll be your devil if you'll admit you're mine)
I don't want you and I don't need you 
don't bother to resist, I'll beat you 
It's not your fault that you're always wrong 
the weak ones are there to justify the strong 
the beautiful people, the beautiful people 
it's all relative to the size of your steeple 
you can't see the forest for the trees 
you can't smell 
your own shit on your knees 
Hey you, what do you see? 
something beautiful, something free? 
hey you, are you trying to be mean? 
if you live with apes man, it's hard to be clean 
there's no time to discriminate, 
hate every motherfucker 
that's in your way 
the worms will live in every host 
it's hard to pick which one they eat most 
the horrible people, the horrible people 
it's as anatomic as the size of your steeple 
capitalism has made it this way, 
old-fashioned fascism 
will take it away 


I put a spell on you 
Because you're mine. 
I can't stand the things that you do. 
No, no, no, I ain't lyin'. 
No. 
I don't care if you don't want me 
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow. 
Yeah, I'm yours, yours, yours.

When you're foolin' around. 
I don't care if you don't want me. 
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow. 
Yeah, yours, yours, yours! 
I can't stand your foolin' around. 
If I can't have you, 
No one will! 
I love you, you, you! I love you. I love you. I love you! 
I love you, you, you! 
I don't care if you don't want me. 
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow. 


I am the face of piss and shit and sugar

We were neurophobic and perfect 
The day that we lost our souls 
Maybe we weren't so human 
If we cry we will rust 
And I was a hand grenade 
That never stopped exploding 
You were automatic and 
As hollow as the 'o' in god 
I am never gonna be the one for you 
I am never gonna save the world from you 
But they'll never be good to you 
Or bad to you 
They'll never be anything 
Anything at all 
You were my mechanical bride 
Phenobarbidoll 
A manniqueen of depression 
With the face of a dead star 
And I was a hand grenade 
That never stopped exploding 
You automatic and 
As hollow as the 'o' in god 
I am never gonna be the one for you 
I am never gonna save the world from you 
But they'll never be good to you 
Or bad to you 
They'll never be anything 
Anything at all 
This isn't me I'm not mechanical 
I'm just a boy 
Playing the suicide king 


On we plow 
The big bully try to stick his finger in my chest 
Try to tell me, tell me he's the best 
But I don't really give a good goddamn cause 
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well 
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well 
I got my lunchbox and I'm armed real well 
I wanna grow up

Wanna go out, gotta get out 
To the playground, gonna throw down at the playground

Today I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt

Today I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I know I'm just dirt

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

Yesterday I was dirty
wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

Yesterday I was dirty
wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

We are the nobodies
we wanna be somebodies
when we're dead,
they'll know just who we are

Some children died the other day
we fed machines and then we prayed
puked up and down in morbid faith
you should have seen the ratings that day


Look at me now 
I've got no religion
Look at me now 
I'm so vacant 
Look at me now 
I was a virgin
Look at me now 
Grew up to be a whore 
And I want it 
I believe it 
I'm a million different things 
And not a one you know 
Hey, and our mommies are lost now 
Hey, daddy's someone else 
Hey, and we love the abuse 
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now 
But I know 
I wanna disappear 
I wanna die young 
And Sell my soul 
Use up all your drugs
And make me come 
Yesterday man, 
I was a nihilist and 
Now today I'm 
Just too fucking bored 
And I want it 
I believe it 
By the time I'm old enough 
I won't know anything at all 
Hey, and our mommies are lost now 
Hey, daddy's someone else 
Hey, and we love the abuse 
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now 
But I know 
I wanna disappear 


Is this what you wanted?
This is what you get.
Turned all your lives into this shit.
You never accepted or treated me fair
blame me for what I believe
and I wear.
You fucked yourselves and you 
raised these sheep
the blue and the withered seeds
you will reap.
You never gave me a chance to be me
Or even a fucking chance just to be.
But I have to show you that 
you played a role
and I will destroy you with one simple hole.
The world that hates me has taken its toll 
but now I have finally taken control.
You wanted so bad to make me this thing
and I want you now to just kill the king

and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve
and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve
and I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
this is what you deserve

King Kill 33
King Kill 33
King Kill 33
King Kill 33

when you wish upon a star 
don't let yourself fall, fall in too hard 
I fell into you and I'm on my back 
an insect decaying in your little trap 
I squirm into you, now I'm in your gut 
I fell into you, now I'm in a rut 
'i lift you up like the sweetest angel, 
i'll tear you down like a whore. 
i will bury your god in my warm spit, 
you'll be deformed in your porn' 
rock star, yeah (you're such a dirty, dirty) 
rock star, yeah (dirty, dirty, dirty) 
you eat up my heart and all the little parts 
your star is so sharp 
it leaves me jagged holes 
I make myself sick just to poison you 
if I can't have you then no one will 
you are the one i want and what i want is so unreal 
i'm such a dirty Rock star yeah... 
(i am the one you want and the one you want is so unreal) 


Her heart shivers in my hand 
She's melting on me like cotton candy 
I make the faces that make you cry 
I want you more when you're afraid of 
My disease, disease is draining me 
Anymore you're not so 'pretty please' 
Disease, disease is draining me 
I want you more when you're afraid of me 
I will break you inside out 
You are mine, you are mine 
I will break you inside out 
You are mine, you are mine 
Her hair hangs in swollen strings 
I'm choking on her, it feels so sickening
I make the faces that make you cry 
I want you more when you're afraid of 
My disease, disease is draining me 
Anymore you're not so pretty, please 
Disease, disease is draining me 
I want you more when you're afraid of me 
I will break you inside out 
You are mine, you are mine 


Yesterday was a million years ago 
In all my past lives I played an asshole 
Now I found you, it's almost too late 
And this earth seems obliviating 
We are trembling in our crutches 
High and dead our skin is glass 
I'm so empty here without you 
I crack my xerox hands 
I know it's the last day on earth 
We'll be together while the planet dies 
I know it's the last day on earth 
We'll never say goodbye 
And the dogs slaughter each other softly 
Love burns its casualties 
We are damaged provider modules 
Spill the seeds at our children's feet 
I'm so empty here without you 
I know they want me dead 
I know it's the last day on earth 
We'll be together while the planet dies 
I know it's the last day on earth 
We'll never say goodbye 


Man in the front got a sinister grin, careen down highway 666 
We wanna go, crush the slow, as the pitchfork bends the
needles grow 
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, my blood is pavement
We're gonna ride to the abbey of the ema, to the abbey of the
ema 
Blood is pavement 
The grill in the front is my sinister grin, bugs in my teeth make
me sick sick sick 
The objects may be larger than they appear in the mirror 
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, my blood is pavement 

We're gonna ride to the abbey of the ema, to the abbey of the
ema 
Blood is pavement 
When you ride you're ridden, when you ride you're ridden 
I am fueled by filth and fury 
Do what I will, I will hurry there, there 
My arms are wheels, my legs are wheels, my blood is pavement 

Blood is pavement
you cut off all of your fingers 
trade them in for dollar bills 
cake on some more make-up to 
cover up all those lines 
wake up and stop shaking 
don't you want some of this? 
don't you need some of this? 
you take but cannot be given 
you ride but cannot be ridden
pinch this tiny heart of mine
wrap it up in soiled twine 
you never read what you've written 
I'll be your lover, i'll be forever
i'll be tomorrow, i am anything when i'm high 
don't you want some of this? 
don't you need some of this? 
you shove your hair down my throat 
i feel your fingers in me 
tear this bitter fruit to mess 
and wrap it in your soiled dress 
now you must spit out the seeds 
all dried up and tied up forever 
all fucked up and dead to the world... 


We are damned and we are dead
all god's children to be sent
to our perfect place in the sun
and in the dirt

There's a windshield in my heart
we are bugs so smeared and scarred
and could you stop the meat from thinking
before I swallow all of it,
could you please?

Put me in the motorcade
put me in the death parade
dress me up and take me
dress me up and make me
your dying god

angels with needles
poked through our eyes
let the ugly light
of the world in
we were no longer blind
we were no longer blind

Put me in the motorcade
put me in the death parade
dress me up and take me
dress me up and make me
your dying god

Now we hold the 'ugly head'
the Mary-whore is at the bed
They've cast the shadow of our perfect death
in the sun and in the dirt.

there's not much left to love 
too tired today to hate 
I feel the empty 
I feel the minute of decay 
I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me I'm on my
way down 
I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me 
I'm on my way down 
the minute that it's born 
it begins to die 
I'd love to just give in, 
I'd love to live this lie 
I've been to black and back 
I've whited out my name 
a lack of pain, a lack of hope, 
a lack of anything to say 
there is no cure for what is killing me 
I'm on my way down 
I've looked ahead and saw a 
world that's dead 
I guess that I am too 
I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me... 

when will realize you're already there? 
so watered down-your feelings have turned to mud. 
'love everybody' is destroying the value of 
all hate has got me nowhere 
I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping away 
oh no, it is everything they said it was 
oh no, I am everything they said I was 
when you you get to heaven you will wish you you're in hell 
when will you realize, you're already here 
you'll think us now that you have crossed over 
don't pick the scabs or you will never heal 
the world shudders as the worm gets its wings 
then i got my wings and i never even knew it 
when i was a worm, thought i wouldn't get through it...

Teenage girl, a teenage queen; 
'Til she's on video -- A PORNO queen! 
She likes to give head. 
She likes it mean. 
That's why she's my little queen. 
Yeah.... 
White boy tryin' to get some behind: 
'Who says date rape isn't kind?' 
Who's he gonna goad? 
Who's he gonna please? 
It don't matter, 
As long as she's on her knees. 


If i had time to kill the world i'd try
Oh no, but i'm busy, killing me
I don't have time to build a suicide
Because the snowman melts in spring
The striper girls will not be coming back
In the summer...for me! me!
I don't have time to even say good-bye
We are dying...As winter lives...spring!
Snow melts in my lawn and i am free...yeah!
Corn cob pipe and a button nose...yeah
Bottled in the ground too long a...
Snow melts in my lawn and i am...
If i had time to kill the world i'd try
But i'm busy, kill is ever me
I don't have time to even say good-bye
We are dying...As winter lives...spring!
Snow melts in my lawn and i am free...yeah!
Corn cob pipe and a button nose...yeah
Spring!
Dear god do you want to tear your knuckles down 
and hold yourself

Dear god can you climb up that tree
meat in the shape of a 'T'

Dear god the paper says you were the King 
in the black limousine

Dear John and all the King's men
can't put you head together again

Before the bullets
before the flies
before authorities take out my eyes
the only smiling are you dolls that I made
but you are plastic and so are your brains

Dear god the sky is as blue
as a gunshot wound

Dear god if you were alive
you know we'd kill you

Before the bullets
before the flies
before authorities take out my eyes
the only smiling are you dolls that I made
but you are plastic and so are your brains 


he is the angel with the scabbed wings 
hard-drug face, want to powder his nose
he will deflower the freshest crop 
dry up all the wombswith his rock and roll sores 
dead 
is what he is, he does what he please 
the things that he has you'll never want to see 
what you're never gonna be now 
sketch a little keyhole for looking-glass people 
you don't want to be him 
you only want to see him 
mommy's got a scarecrow, gotta let the corn grow 
man can't always reap what he sow 
'he is the maker' 
(he is the taker) 
'he is the saviour' 
(he is the raper) 
(verse 2) 
get back you're never gonna leave him 
get back you're always gonna please him 


There's something cold and blank behind her smile 
She's standing on an overpass 
In her miracle mile 
(coma): 
You were from a perfect world 
A world that threw me away today 
Today to run away 
A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
A pill to make you anybody else 
But all the drugs in this world 
Won't save her from herself 
Her mouth was an empty cut 
And she was waiting to fall 
Just bleeding like a polaroid that
Lost all her dolls 
(coma): 
You were from a perfect world 
A world that threw me away today 
Today to run away 
A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
A pill to make you anybody else 
But all the drugs in this world 
Won't save her from herself 
this is evolution
the monkey
the man
and then the gun
if Christ was in Texas
the hammer
the sickle
the only son
this is your creation
the atom of Eden
was a bomb 
if Jack was the Baptist
we'd drink wine
from the head

this is evolution
the monkey
the man
and then the gun

I am a revolution
pull my knuckles down
if I could
I am a revelation
and I'm nailed
to the Holy Wood

this is evolution
the monkey 
the man
and then the gun

we are dead and tomorrow's canceled
because of things we did yesterday
we are dead and tomorrow's canceled
they crucify us in our space
in our space
in our space

this is evolution 
the monkey
the man
and then the gun
flies are waiting


We have no future
heaven wasn't made for me
we burn ourselves to hell
as fast as it can be
and I wish that I could be a king
then I'd know that I am not alone

Maggots put on shirts
Sell each others shit
sometimes I feel so worthless
sometimes I feel discarded
I wish that I was good enough
then I'd know that I am not alone

Death is policeman
Death is the priest
Death is the stereo
Death is a TV
Death is the Tarot
Death is an angel and
Death is our God
killing us all

she puts the seeds in me
plant this dying tree
she's a burning string
and I'm just the ashes

she put the seeds in me
plant this dying tree
she's a burning string
and I'm just the ashes


Sweet dreams are made of this. 
Who am I to disagree? 
Travel the world and the seven seas. 
Everybody's looking for something. 
(Chorus: Some of them want to use you. 
Some of them want to get used by you. 
Some of them want to abuse you. 
Some of them want to be abused.) 
(Repeat First Verse) 
I wanna use you and abuse you. 
I wanna know what's inside you. 
(Whispering and Moaning: Hold your head up, movin' on. 
Keep your head up, movin' on.) 
(Repeat Three Times) 
Movin' on! 
(Repeat First Verse) 
I'm gonna use you and abuse you. 
I'm gonna know what's inside. 
Gonna use you and abuse you. 
I'm gonna know what's inside you. 

She was the color of TV
her mouth curled under like a metal snake
although Holy Wood was sad
they'd remember this as Valentine's day

flies are waiting

In the Shadow of the Valley of Death
In the Shadow of the Valley of Death

slit our wrists and send us to heaven
the first flower after the flood

I saw that pregnant girl today
she didn't know that it was dead inside
even though it was alive
some of us are really born to die

flies are waiting

In the Shadow of the Valley of Death
In the Shadow of the Valley of Death

slit our wrists and send us to heaven
the first flower after the flood

In the Shadow of the Valley of Death
In the Shadow of the Valley of Death

She's got eyes like zapruder 
And a mouth like heroin 
She wants me to be 
Perfect like Kennedy 
This isn't god, this isn't god 
God is just a statistic, 
God is just a statistic 
Say, 
Show me the dead stars, 
All of them sing 
This is a orion 
Religious and clean 
God is a number you cannot count to 
You are posthuman and hardwired 
She's pilgrim and pagan 
Softworn and so-cial 
In all of her dreams 
She's a saint like Jackie-O 
This isn't god, this isn't god 
God is just a statistic, 
God is just a statistic 
Say, show me the dead stars, 
All of them sing 
This is a orion 
Religious and clean 
(Coma White): 
All that glitters is cold, all that glitters is cold 


Go ahead and date a dead messiah 
We can dig another grave. 
This is your calling 
If you are hearing this, there is nothing I can do 
Something has grown out of my chest. 
I have seen it. 
It is hard and cold.
It has been dormant for many years. 
We are trying to save you, I have come to save you 
This is what you deserve, 
this is what we deserve 
This is something we have brought upon ourselves. 
We are not a victim, you are not a victim 
we are not a victim, you are not a victim 
God will grovel before me 
God will crawl at my feet. 
And the time is this 
And the time is... 
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you... 
I want to know why is it that all of you seem to have satanic signs 
all over you and what is it...does
This music cause you to do what you do
(Manson) was that directed at us or to the parents thats funny
(Twiggy, Manson and Phil Donahue at the same time) does the music 
cause us to do what we do
(Manson) i think we cause the music i think that moshing is a sign 
of what christians would call uh uh apocalypse
(Madonna to Twiggy) stop nashing yer teeth Manson uh uh the culture is 
just getting more and more destructive and i think this is just a sign 
of the times this and dancing with the one legged is 
from the phil donah show they did
She's got her eyes open wide
she's got the dirt and spit of the world
her mouth on the metal 
the lips of a scared little girl

I've got an angel in the lobby
he's waiting to put me in line
I won't ask forgiveness
my faith has gone dry

She's got her Christian prescriptures
and death has crawled in her ear
like elevator music of songs
that she shouldn't hear

and it spins around 1...2...3
and we all lay down 4...5...6
some do it fast 
some do it better in smaller amounts

and it spins around 1...2...3
and we all lay down 4...5...6
some do it fast 
some do it better in smaller amounts 
Use me when you want to come 
I've bled just to have your touch
When I'm in you I want to die 
User friendly fucking dopestar obscene 
Will you die when you're high 
You'd never die just for me 
She says, 
I'm not in love, but I'm gonna fuck you 
'til somebody better comes along. 
Use me like I was a whore 
Relationships are such a bore 
Delete the ones that you've fucked 
User friendly fucking dopestar obscene
Will you die when you're high 
You'd never die just for me 
She says, 
I'm not in love, but I'm gonna fuck you 
'til somebody better comes along. 


you built me up with your wishing hell 
I didn't have to sell you 
you threw your money in the pissing well
you do just what they tell you 
REPENT, that's what I'm talking about 
i shed the skin to feed the fake 
REPENT, that's what I'm talking about 
whose mistake am i anyway? 
Cut the head off 
Grows back hard 
I am the hydra 
now you'll see your star 
prick your finger it is done 
the moon has now eclipsed the sun 
the angel has spread its wings 
the time has come for bitter things (chorus) 
the time has come it is quite clear 
our antichrist 
is almost here... 
it is done 


I sit here all knowing
Knowing nothing here at all
My cut spread slower
Pig hands reach into my sides
I hate this life you give me
I give you hate you live for me
I love the pain you give me
This hurting feels like love to me
They go down, down...
Down inside
They go down town, down town
They go down town to sell
My body hangs on hooks
A cloth to society
Your dollars wet my skin
Makes me papier mache thrift
I hate this life you give me
I give you hate you live for me
I love the pain
I love this hurting feels like love to me
They go down...
Down town, down town they go
Down town, down town to sell me
I want to wake up in your 
White, white sun 
And I want to wake up in your world 
With no pain 
But I'll just suffer in a hope to die someday 
While you are numb all of the way 
When I hate it I know I can feel but 
When you love you know it's not real 
No 
And I am resigned to this wicked fucking world
On its way to hell 
The living are dead and 
I hope to join them too 
I know what to do and I do it well... 
When I hate it I know I can feel but 
When you love you know it's not real 
No 
Shoot myself to love you 
If I loved myself I'd be shooting you 


she's made of hair and bone and little teeth 
and things I cannot speak 
she comes on like a crippled plaything 
spine is just a string 
I wrapped our love in all this foil 
silver-tight like spider legs 
I never wanted it to ever spoil 
but flies will always lay their eggs 
Take your hatred out on me 
make your victim my head 
you never ever believed in me 
I am your tourniquet 
prosthetic synthesis with butterfly 
sealed up with virgin stitch 
if it hurts, just tell me 
preserve the innocence 
I never wanted it to end this way 
but flies will lay their eggs 


there's an apple in the pussy mouth 
now I am the dinner whore 
there's a tumor in the t.v. mouth 
burn it out before it grows 
someone better get the dog to kick, 
jaws wired shut to save the dick 
out of the bottomless pit comes the little horn 
'little horn is born' 
the world spreads its legs for another star 
world shows its face for another scar 
dead will dance for what is left 
the worms will wait with baited breath 
'your blind have now become my deaf' 
so says this little horn 
'save yourself from this...' 


We live in a country were parents raise they're children
To feal ashamed for not being like them with christian
Morality and theese kids need a way to react against it your
Goin to have a bunch of angry kids
well when yew do go out to a club you gotta watch
Yourself whatever you do you cant epect to go out there and
Not get touched and nonviolent cus that what it is
i don i don see
when you get the music inside yer soul any thing
Gonna happen you don't
Play the music you cant get it its the musicthe music
Each time i make my mother cry an 
angel dies and falls from heaven 
when the boy is still a worm it's hard to 
learn the number seven 
but when they get to you 
it's the first thing that they do 
each time I look outside 
my mother dies, I feel my back is changing shape 
when the worm consumes the boy it's never 
considered rape 
when they get to you 
prick your finger it is done... 
the moon has now eclipsed the sun... 
the angel has spread its wings... 
the time has come for bitter things... 


Cyclops woman got one eye in her head 
Mascera-clotted vision she is fed 
Cyclops woman can't see nothing at all 
She got a pin prick spiral hole 
She can't see nothing, nothing at all 
She can't see nothing, nothing at all 
Cyclops woman dying in her shell 
Guilt got her trapped in nailed in well 
Cyclops woman is the eye of the world 
Who's reflection's in the retina? 
he can't see nothing, nothing at all 
She can't see nothing, nothing at all 
Dialate, dialate 


There's no earthly way of knowing 
Which direction we are going 
There's no knowing where we're going 
Or which way the wind is blowing 
Is it raining? Is it snowing 
Is a hurricane a-blowing 
Not a speck of light is showing 
So the danger must be growing 
Oh, the fires of hell are glowing 
Is the grisly reaper mowing 
Yes! The danger must be growing 
For the rowers keep on rowing 
And they're certainly not showing 
Any signs that they are slowing! 
Stop the boat! 


Burn the witches, burn the witches, 
don't take time to sew your stiches 
Burn the witches, burn the witches 
Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor 
You cannot sedate all the things you hate 
Burn your bridges, burn your bridges, 
don't take time to sew your stiches 
Burn your bridges, burn your bridges 
Good is the thing that you favor, evil is your sour flavor 
I don't need your hate, I decide my fate 
You cannot sedate all the things you rape 


The clock is a ring on her finger
That she checks
When she's out of time
The cigarette's a spike
In the spur of the moment
Digging in her side
She cuts the paper with nails
And her pen is bleeding poetry
Nervous from the sex that she got
And the wine that she spilled
On her clean, white, white sheets
Like to see you, baby,
All torn up inside
Girl you're dead already
So just let your ego die
Girl you're dead already
So just let your ego die
Die, die, die
Smack dab flat on my back
The solid ground begins to crack
I pulled her down and down and down
I lost my breath i thought i'd drown

Fistfuls of you, fistfuls of you
You pulled me through with white knuckles
White knuckles. White knuckles

Her leg, my hand, a smoldering brand
Sticking to her wet body like sand
Her place, distaste, we fell from grace
Red smears across her face

(To justify my love)
I want you to my balls
In paris, niagara falls
I want you to lick my toes
los angeles, san francisco,
With the fags and the 'ho's
Wanting, waiting
For you
To justify my love
Wanting, waiting
For you
To justify my love
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Wanting, waiting
For you
To justify my love
Wanting, waiting
For you
To justify my love
Fuck frankie
Fuck frankie
Fuck frankie
Fuck, fuck

The Abraham Lincoln town cars
arrive to dispose of our king and queen
they orchestrated dramatic new scenes
for Celebritarian needs

When one world ends
something else begins
but without a scream
just a whisper because we
just start it over again
