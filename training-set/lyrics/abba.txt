I've seen you twice
In a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me
For every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please
'Cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child
Beginning to grow

And you make me talk (doo-doo doo-doo)
And you make me feel (doo-doo doo-doo)
And you make me show (doo-doo doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (doo-doo doo-doo)
If I trust in you (doo-doo doo-doo)
Would you let me down? (doo-doo doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (doo-doo doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? (aah)
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know

The name of the game

I have no friends
No one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here
Talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game? (your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you? (got a feeling you give me no choice)
But it means a lot
What's the name of the game? (your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please
'Cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child
Beginning to grow

And you make me talk (doo-doo doo-doo)
And you make me feel (doo-doo doo-doo)
And you make me show (doo-doo doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (doo-doo doo-doo)
If I trust in you (doo-doo doo-doo)
Would you let me down? (doo-doo doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (doo-doo doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? (aah)
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know
Oh yes, I wanna know

The name of the game (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you? (but I think I can see in your face)
And it means a lot
What's the name of the game? (your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do? (got a feeling you give me no choice)
But it means a lot
What's the name of the game? (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you? (but I think I can see in your face)
And it means a lot

They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high (I can fly)
I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, High
What a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high (I can fly)
I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, High
What a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas

And to go anywhere that I please 
I got appointments
Work I have to do
Keepin' me so busy
All the day through
They're the things that keep me from thinkin' of you
Oh, baby I miss you so
I know I'm never gonna make it

Oh, I'm so restless
I don't care what I say
And I lose my temper
Ten times a day
Still it's even worse when the night's on it's way
It's bad
Oh, so bad

Somehow I'd be doin' alright
If it wasn't for the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight
If it wasn't for the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall
Even I could see a light
If it wasn't for the nights (even I could see a light, I think that I could make it)
Somehow I'd be doin' alright
If it wasn't for the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

No one to turn to
You know how it is
I was not prepared for
Something like this
Now I see them clearly the things that I miss
Oh, baby I feel so bad
I know I'm never gonna make it

I've got my business
To help me through the day
People I must write to
Bills I must pay
But everything's so different, when night's on it's way
It's bad
Oh, so bad

Somehow I'd be doin' alright
If it wasn't for the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight
If it wasn't for the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall
Even I could see a light
If it wasn't for the nights (even I could see a light, I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright
If it wasn't for the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)

If it
Wasn't
For the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
If it
Wasn't
For the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)

Even I could see a light
If it wasn't for the nights (even I could see a light, I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright
If it wasn't for the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

If it
Wasn't
For the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
If it
Wasn't
For the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

Even I could see a light
If it wasn't for the nights (even I could see a light, I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright
If it wasn't for the nights (if it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

Super Trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat, and sleep, and sing
Wishing every show was the last show (wishing every show was the last show)
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you coming)
Suddenly I feel alright (and suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Super Trouper
Lights are gonna find me 
Shining like the sun (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Smiling, having fun (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Super Trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Like I always do (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you

Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends 
Still I'm thinking about you only (still I'm thinking about you only)
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (think I'm going, think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright ('cause you'll be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Super Trouper
Lights are gonna find me 
Shining like the sun (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Smiling, having fun (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Super Trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Like I always do (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you

So I'll be there
When you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me
I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

Tonight the (sup-per-per trou-per-per)
Super Trouper
Lights are gonna find me

e had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife

He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people different ages
But they had nothing to say (nothing to say)
At least not until the day ('til that day)
When something special he read
This is what it said

If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get
Two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get
Two for the price of one

If you dream of the girl for you (if you are dreaming of the one which will be right for you)
Then call us and get (why don't you call us and you'll get two)
Two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue (we may be the answer to your problem - if by chance you feel blue) 
So call us and get (why don't you call us and you'll get two)
Two for the price of one

He called the number and a voice said
Alice Whiting
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck

He said I read your ad it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat? (meet for a chat)
The three of us in my flat (in my flat)
I can't forget what I read
This is what it said

If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get
Two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get
Two for the price of one

If you dream of the girl for you (if you are dreaming of the one which will be right for you)
Then call us and get (why don't you call us and you'll get two)
Two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue (we may be the answer to your problem - if by chance you feel blue) 
So call us and get (why don't you call us and you'll get two)
Two for the price of one

She said, I'm sure we must be perfect for each other
And if you doubt it, you'll be certain when you meet my mother
Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes
There is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see
That you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend
I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see
You've broken a feather (how it hurts to see you cry and how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope
We can patch it up together

Chiquitita
You and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leavin'
You'll be dancin' once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grievin'

Chiquitita
You and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you (even though we cry the sun is shining in the sky, so)
Let me hear you sing once more
Like you did before (let me hear you sing some more the way you used to do before)
Sing a new song
Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song
Chiquitita

So the walls came tumblin' down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone
And it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see
That you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita
You and I know
How the heartaches come and they go 
And the scars they're leavin' (you and I we know how all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancin' once again
And the pain will end (and you'll be dancing once again, and all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grievin'

Chiquitita
You and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you (even though we cry the sun is shining in the sky, so)
Let me hear you sing once more
Like you did before (let me hear you sing some more the way you used to do before)
Sing a new song
Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song
Chiquitita

Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song
Chiquitita

I keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, aah

Last night
I was takin' a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought
Maybe I should walk right up to her and say (aha-ha)
It's a game he likes to play

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh, no no no no

A a-ah
A a-ah a-ah ah
A a-ah
A a-ah a-ah ah
A a-ah
I keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, aah

Sometimes
When I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time
When I see him will it bring back all the pain? (aha-ha)
How can I forget that name

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Crazy 'bout his angel eyes
Angel eyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh, no no no no

A a-ah
A a-ah a-ah ah
A a-ah
A a-ah a-ah ah
A a-ah
I keep thinking
A a-ah a-ah ah
I keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
A a-ah
I keep thinking
A a-ah a-ah ah
I keep thinking I've had to pay the price
A a-ah
I keep thinking
A a-ah a-ah ah
I keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
A a-ah
I keep thinking
A a-ah a-ah ah
I keep thinking I've had to pay the price
They say a restless body
Can hide a peaceful soul
A voyager and a settler
They both have a distant goal
If I explore the heavens
Or if I search inside
Well, it really doesn't matter
As long as I can tell myself
I've always tried

Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion
Move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of
Being in it
With the urge to move on

I've travelled every country
I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey
A trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead
And living things
The will to stay alive

Like a roller in the ocean (la-la la la-la la la...)
Life is motion
Move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of
Being in it
With the urge to move on

The morning breeze that ripples
The surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls
That hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain?
The wonder of the moment
To be alive
To feel the sun
That follows every rain

Like a roller in the ocean (la-la la la-la la la...)
Life is motion
Move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of
Being in it
With the urge to move on

La-la la la-la la la (move on)
La-la la la-la la la
La la-la la la (move on)
Like a wind that's always blowing
La-la la la-la la la (it's blowing)
La-la la la-la la la
La la-la la la (move on)
Like the sunrise in the morning
La-la la la-la la la (life is dawning)
La-la la la-la la la
La la-la la la (move on)
How I treasure every minute (la-la laaha)
Being part of (la-la laaha)
Being in it
With the urge to move on
Everybody screamed
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush
He looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken

By surprise (hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (oh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (oh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (oh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath
The world stood still
But then he just smiled (smiled, I wanna kiss him)
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care
Gonna teach him a lesson alright

I was in a trance (oh, my I wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (oh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (oh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (oh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry (hug him, wanna kiss him)
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care
Gonna teach him a lesson alright

What a crazy day (hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (ooh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
All my sense had flown away (ooh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (ooh, hug hug him, wanna kiss him, wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath
The world stood still
But then he just smiled (smiled, I wanna kiss him)
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher (I wanna hug, hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher (I wanna hug, hug him)
I've always hated my room
It's so gloomy and dreary
Always too dark
For the windows just face the back yard
So I
Can't understand how it's happened
How everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room
It all got so much brighter
You must have a

Lovelight
Everything around you is
Lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere (love that's shining)
Maybe even when you're not there (love that's shining)
Got lovelight
Everything around you is
Lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night (love that's shining)
I won't let you out of my sight (love that's shining)
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose your
Lovelight

How I remember
The first time we went to a movie
We had decided to meet
On a corner downtown
And I
Waited there when you came up from behind
And you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life
It all got so much brighter
You must have a

Lovelight
Everything around you is
Lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere (love that's shining)
Maybe even when you're not there (love that's shining)
Got lovelight
Everything around you is
Lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night (love that's shining)
I won't let you out of my sight (love that's shining)
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose your
Lovelight

And I feel so good
And I feel so high
And I know that
You must have a
Lovelight

Got lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere (love that's shining)
Maybe even when you're not there (love that's shining)
You've got
Lovelight
Everything around you is
Lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night (love that's shining)
I won't let you out of my sight (love that's shining)
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose your
Lovelight 
Sit down and listen

h, my love it makes me sad
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had? 

Baby, give me one more
Dance, while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance, and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye 

Yes, all we have to do is
Dance, while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance, while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye 

Yet, it seems to make me sad
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had? 

Baby, give me one last
Dance, while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance, and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?
So dance, while the music still goes on
It's gonna be our last goodbye 

Dance, while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance, and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye 

Dance, while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying 

Dance, while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance, and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
People everywhere
A sense of expectation
Hangin' in the air
Givin' out a spark
Across the room your eyes
Are glowin' in the dark
And here we go again
We know the start
We know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it long before
And now we're back
To get some more
You know what I mean

Voulez-vous (aha)
Take it now or leave it (aha)
Now is all we get (aha)
Nothing promised
No regrets
Voulez-vous (aha)
Ain't no big decision (aha)
You know what to do (aha)
Pas question
C'est voulez-vous
Voulez-vous

I know what you think
The girl means business
So I'll offer her a drink
Lookin' mighty proud
See you leave your table
Pushin' through the crowd
I'm really glad you came
You know the rules
You know the game
Master of the scene
We've done it long before
And now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean

Voulez-vous (aha)
Take it now or leave it (aha)
Now is all we get (aha)
Nothing promised

Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet, sweet talk
Ain't heard it a lot since then, love
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry
He leaves every morning and he hardly says goodbye
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling I know 

We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet) 

Giving
Love is a reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough 

From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen
I've given you lots of presents
Now listen to that, just look at that cat
You'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling I know 

We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet) 

Giving (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet)
Love is a reason for living (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough 

Patience (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet)
Love isn't just a sensation (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet)
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet) 

Giving (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet)
Love is a reason for living (sweet, sweet our love is bitter-sweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough 
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember long ago
Another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself
And softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life
And none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night
We crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in you eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando 
Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was
due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I
must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to
be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have
rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of
the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me
away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished
school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual
frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food
to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I
didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that
style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another
night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of
rain
The day before you came
I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation
She keeps going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles everyday
She's a girl
With a taste
For the world
(The world is like a playing-ground
Where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme
If you know
What I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says: That's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry'
And with no trace of hesitation
She keeps on going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles everyday
She's a girl
With a taste
For the world
(The world is like a playing-ground
Where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme
If you know
What I mean

You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation
She keeps on going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles everyday
She's a girl
With a taste
For the world
(The world is like a playing-ground
Where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme
If you know
What I mean

I think she's one of those who
Always likes to do whatever she feels
And she goes
Head over heels 
You think you're gonna make me soft with your fancy car
But I can tell you all of your tricks ain't gonna get you far
They say that money's got a magic touch
But not to me, it doesn't mean that much
You won't have me tonight
All right, all right, all right, all right

So long (ooh, honey honey)
See you honey (honey honey honey)
Can't buy me with you money (ooh, money money)
Tracy, Daisy
They may be crazy
But I'll never be your girl
So long (ooh, honey honey)
See you honey (honey honey honey)
Can't buy me with your money (ooh, money money)
You know it's not worth trying
So long, so long, so long (ooh, honey-hon honey hon-honey ooh, mon-mon money money money)

You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today
I wouldn't keep a thing from you, I gave them all away
The girls might fall for everything you've got
But I'm not one of them
You know I'm not
You won't have me tonight
All right, all right, all right, all right

So long (ooh, hon-hon)
See you honey (ooh, hon-honey)
Can't buy me with your money (ooh, mon-money)
Tracy, Daisy
They may be crazy
But I'll never be your girl
So long (ooh, hon-hon)
See you honey (ooh, hon-honey)
Can't buy me with your money (ooh, mon-money)
You know it's not worth trying
So long, so long, so long (ooh, honey-hon hon-hon-honey)

So long (ooh, hon-hon)
See you honey (ooh, hon-honey)
Can't buy me with your money (ooh, mon-money)
You know it's not worth trying
So long
So long
So long (ooh, honey-hon oh, honey honey)

So long
So long
So long (ooh, honey-hon honey honey honey)

So long
So long
So long (ooh, honey-hon ooh, honey honey)
I'm hearing images
I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me
Straight to my heart
So strange
Yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak
With no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away
Into the world
Where beauty meets
The darkness of the day

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me

(better wake me)
(and I'm glad you) (let 'em take me) 
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce
If it makes me laugh
For a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart
Speaking to a heart
Let it be a cry

Some streets are emptiness
Dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night
I find myself
A blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak
Leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me on the way
Into a place
Where beauty will
Defeat the darkest day

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(an illusion)
(no disturbance)
(no intrusion)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce
If it makes me laugh
For a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart
Speaking to a heart
Let it be a cry
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart
Speaking to a heart
Let it be a cry

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me
And let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak
I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I'd belong there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The winner takes it all (takes it all)
The loser has to fall (has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (yes, it's plain)
Why should I complain? (why complain?)

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (will decide)
The likes of me abide (me abide)
Spectators of the show (of the show)
Always staying low (staying low)
The game is on again (on again)
A lover or a friend (or a friend)
A big thing or a small (big or small)
The winner takes it all (takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see

The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

So the winner
Takes it all
And the loser
Has to fall
Throw a dice
Cold as ice
Way down here
Someone dear

Takes it all
Has to fall
Yes, it's plain
Why complain? 
You feel bad
Let me tell you
We all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden
Way down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst (and when you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed (any kind of sad)
Well, if there's one thing
For the better
That can turn you loose

It's gotta be rock 'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock 'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

My friend Sam is a chauffeur
Annie goes to school
Jerry works at the office
Sue lies by the pool
But on all week-ends (we get together again)
When I meet my friends (hmm, I wanna see them now)
And we're lookin' 'round
For the action
We sure play it cool

It's gotta be rock 'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock 'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

Aha, aha, aha You paint your world
And use all colours
Aha, aha And then you find
It all comes out too bright
You know it's only a lie
Aha, aha, aha The songs you sing
Are too romantic
Aha, aha And when you want the truth
They only spit in your eye
Oh, yeah, they're only tellin' you lie
Oh, yeah, there's gotta be rock n' roll
To fill the hole in your soul

You feel bad
Let me tell you
We all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden
Way down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst (you know you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed (any kind of sad)
Well, if there's one thing
For the better
That can turn you loose

It's gotta be rock 'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock 'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Don't know how to take it
Don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter
And it troubles me so

(You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and
Yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be

Under attack (I'm being)
I'm being taken (I'm being taken)
About to crack
Defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart? (won't somebody have a heart)
Come and rescue me now
'Cause I'm falling apart

Under attack (I'm taking)
I'm taking cover (I'm taking cover)
He's on my track
My chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now (thinking nothing can stop him now)
Should I want to
I'm not sure I would know how

This is getting crazy
I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions
Is a definite 'no'

(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered
But I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen
Where I'd be if I fell

Under attack (I'm being)
I'm being taken (I'm being taken)
About to crack
Defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart? (won't somebody have a heart)
Come and rescue me now
'Cause I'm falling apart

Under attack (I'm taking)
I'm taking cover (I'm taking cover)
He's on my track
My chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now (thinking nothing can stop me now)
Should I want to
I'm not sure I would know how
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything 

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My My, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go 

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you 'we're through'
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything 

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
'Bye bye, leave me now or never'
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
'Bye bye' doesn't mean forever 

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
See me sitting in the palm tree
Looking down at people passing by
Sitting here no one can harm me
They just stare at me and wonder why
No need to bother
I'm gonna stay up here
Whatever happens
I won't let no one near
Until you tell me
Jeanie, Jeanie on my mind
Won't you please
You really love me
Jeanie, Jeanie you're so fine
Yes you are now
And in the evening
When the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest
Of men in this town
'Cause I love you
Jeanie, Jeanie on my mind 

See me sitting in the palm tree
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo
But I will stay here
Among my coconuts
So you will know dear
You're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me
Jeanie, Jeanie on my mind 

Winds blow
Stars glow
I see a light in her window
Dark trees
Soft breeze
Carry my message to her, please 

See me sitting in the palm tree
Getting angry at the silly crowd
No one else but you can calm me
You should know by now I'm far too proud
I need to show you
I've got my feelings too
You shouldn't treat me
Like you always do
So won't you tell me
Jeanie, Jeanie on my mind
Won't you please
You really love me
Jeanie, Jeanie you're so fine
Yes you are now
And in the evening
When the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest
Of men in this town
'Cause I love you
Jeanie, Jeanie on my mind

Jeanie, Jeanie you're so fine
Jeanie, Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie, Jeanie you're so fine
Jeanie, Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie, Jeanie you're so fine
The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right, the Paris night
Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the Elys&#233;e
We had a drink in each caf&#233;
And you
You talk of politics, philosophy
And I
Smile like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years
That was the time of the flower-power
But underneath
We had a fear of flying
Of getting old
A fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Yet, you're the hero of my dreams

I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play
Do I hear what I think I'm hearing?
Do I see the signs I think I see?
Or is this just a fantasy?
Is it true that the beast is waking?
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight
In the pale moonlight
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that
Soldiers sing the songs that
You and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world
Was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that
Soldiers sing the songs that
You and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Taking a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

What's that sound?
What's that dreadful rumble?
Won't somebody tell me what I hear
In the distance but drawing near?
Is it only a storm approaching?
All that thunder and the blinding light
In the winter night
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that
Soldiers sing the songs that
You and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world
Was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that
Soldiers sing the songs that
You and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Taking a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

Soldiers write the songs that
Soldiers sing the songs that
You and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Taking a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance
Schoolbag in hand
She leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye
With an absent-minded smile
I watch her go
With a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm loosing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes
Her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake
I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone
There's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt
I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go (slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well some of that we did
But most we didn't
And why I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time (slipping through my fingers)

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Schoolbag in hand
She leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile 
I was at a party and this feller said to me
Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights

I said who are you to talk about impending doom?
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, I'm a minister, a big shot in the state
I said, I just can't believe it, boy, I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?
He said, keep on rocking baby, 'till the night is gone

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Till the night is gone
On and on and on
'Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Till the night is gone
On and on and on
'Till the night is gone

Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, 'who am I and who are you and who are we?'
'What's our situation, do we have some time for us?'
I said, 'I was not exactly waiting for the bus'
He said, 'if you're going somewhere can I come along?'
I said, 'keep on rocking baby 'till the night is gone'

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Till the night is gone
On and on and on
'Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Till the night is gone
On and on and on
'Till the night is gone
You're so hot
Teasing me
So you're blue but I can't
Take a chance on a chick like you
It's something I couldn't do

There's that look
In your eyes
I can read in your face
That your feelings are driving you wild
Oh, but girl you're only a child

Well, I could dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I could chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

I can see
What you want
But you seem pretty young
To be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one

Now, you're so cute
I like your style
And I know what you mean
When you give me a flash of that smile (smile)
But girl you're only a child

Well, I could dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I could chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

Well, I could dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I could chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out? 
You're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet, I feel I'm like an outward bound
Pushed around refugee

Something's wrong
Got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I had come from out of space
Out of place, like King-Kong

I'm a marionette Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette
Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Like a doll
Like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk
How to walk, how to fall

Can't complain
I got no one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control
Lost my hold, it's insane

I'm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette
Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Look this way
Just a little smile
Is what they say
You'll look better on the photograph
If you laugh, that's OK!!

I'm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

You're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet, I feel I'm like an outward bound
Pushed around refugee
Sometimes when I'm mad
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad
Sometimes when I scream
There's a voice in me that says you shouldn't be so mean
Oh no
Oh no
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside
Yes, I am to myself
What Jekyll must have been to Hyde

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
We're a funny combination
Me and I
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute and you'll find the answer in it
Everyone's a freak

Sometimes I have toyed
With ideas that I got from good old Dr. Freud
Nothing new of course
It may seem to you
I try to break through open doors
Oh no
Oh no
I just wanna say
A lot of that applies to me
'Cause it's an explanation to my split identity (ty-ty-ty-ty-ty-ty-ty-ty-ty-ty-ty-ty)

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
We're a funny combination
Me and I
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute and you'll find the answer in it
Everyone's a freak

Me and I

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
We're a funny combination
Me and I
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute and you'll find the answer in it
Everyone's a freak
I hear the door-bell ring and
Suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me

The signal's sounding once again
And someone tries the door-knob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming
Through the door I feel I'm
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder
Irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now I'm
In here trembling in a
Terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling
Going crazy there is
No escaping now I'm
Crackin' up

These walls have witnessed all the
Anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming
Through the door I feel I'm
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder
Irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now I'm
In here trembling in a
Terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling
Going crazy there is
No escaping now I'm
Crackin' up

I have been waiting for these visitors
You hate
You scream
You swear
And still you never reach him
You curse
You try
To scare
But you can never teach him

It's a dead end street
They tie your hands
And tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
A nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine

Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You know they're gonna get you
You try
To break
Away
But they will never let you

It's a dead end street
They tie your hands
And tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
The nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine

You're like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind
They'll take your soul

You come
You stay
You go
It really doesn't matter
You've done
It all
Before
By now they know the pattern

It's a dead end street
They tie your hands
And tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
The nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine

You're like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind
They'll take your soul

Nowhere to go
You know they're gonna get you
Nowhere to go
You know they'll never let you

It's a dead end street
They tie your hands
And tie your feet
And the street is narrow
The nowhere lane
The nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine

You're like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind
They'll take your soul

Nowhere to go
You know they're gonna get you
Nowhere to go
You know they'll never let you... 
No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are
Me and you
Feeling lost
And feeling blue
It's the end
Of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike
Yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see 
How it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be ok
Dragging on (ooh)
Feet of clay (ooh)
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going
Anyway

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead
Nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end (end)
Of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say (ooh)
What we'll find (ooh)
What lies waiting
Down the line
In the end of
Eighty-nine?

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
You and I
I'm nothing special
In fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke
You've probably heard it before
But I have a talent
A Wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens
When I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say

Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy
They're bringing
Who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was
A dancer before I could walk
She says I began
To sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered
How did it all start?
Who found out that nothing
Can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well who ever it was, I'm a fan
So I say

Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy
They're bringing
Who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy
What a life
What a chance

Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy
They're bringing
Who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Well, I was looking at a movie on the TV last night
Then I had a very funny notion, yeah
I really had to write a song about it
And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock'n roll band
And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah
I know that everybody's gonna shout it 

But what a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla 

We do the King Kong song
Won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the King Kong song
Gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song 

Now we can make a jungle out of any old place
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah
Well, who can tell a monkey from a monkey?
So, people get together, gonna have a good time
Everybody listen to the music, yeah
The song we're gonna sing is kinda funky 

So let your arms hang down
And waddle all around
Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla 

We do the King Kong song
Won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the King Kong song
Gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song 

Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla 

We do the King Kong song
Won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the King Kong song
Gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song 
Lay your head on my chest
So you hear every beat of my heart
Now there's nothing at all
That can keep us apart
Touch my lips
Close your eyes
And see with your fingertips
Things that you do
And you know I'm crazy 'bout you

Kisses of fire
Burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire
Sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions (I've had)
I've had my share of love affairs
And they were nothing compared to this
I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

When you sleep by my side
I feel safe
And I know I belong
Still it's making me scared
That my love is so strong
Losing you
It's a nightmare, babe,
And to me it's new
Never before
Did you see me begging for more

Kisses of fire
Burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire
Sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions (I've had)
I've had my share of love affairs
And they were nothing compared to this
I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

Kisses of fire
Burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire
Sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
Kisses of fire
Burning, burning (I'm at the point of no returning)
Kisses of fire
Sweet emotions (I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss)
(Caught in a landslide of emotions)
Take it easy
With me, please
Touch me gently
Like a summer evening breeze
Take your time
Make it slow
Andante, Andante
Just let the feeling grow

Make your fingers
Soft and light
Let your body be the velvet of the night
Touch my soul
You know how
Andante, Andante
Go slowly with me now

I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song (I'm your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again
And make me strong (play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing
Make me sound (you make me sing and you make me Andante, Andante)
Andante, Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante, Andante
Oh, please don't let me down

There's a shimmer
In your eyes
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies
Please don't talk
Go on play
Andante, Andante
And let me float away

I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song (I'm your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again
And make me strong (play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing
Make me sound (you make me sing and you make me Andante, Andante)
Andante, Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante, Andante
Oh, please don't let me down

Make me sing
Make me sound (you make me sing and you make me Andante, Andante)
Andante, Andante
Tread lightly on my ground
Andante, Andante
Oh, please don't let me down

Andante, Andante
Oh, please don't let me down
Went to buy me a paper at the local newsstand
And then I heard them laugh and say
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now
Hey, what's it good for anyway?
So I said fellas Like to ask you a thing if I may 

What about Livingstone?
What about all those men?
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?
What about Livingstone? 

And all of those fellas at the local newsstand
Didn't know what to answer or what to say
So I told them about him, that he was just like
One of those spacemen in his way
And if you laugh at them
Then there's only a thing I can say 

What about Livingstone?
What about all those men?
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then? 

What about Livingstone? (didn't he do it, well didn't he)
What about all those men? (didn't he do it, well didn't he)
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while (didn't he do it, well didn't he)
Travelling up the Nile (didn't he do it)
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest? (didn't that help them, well didn't it)
Wasn't it worth it then?
Did you see that man
In the limousine?
With the pretty
Only, he's fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care
And she never will
If he's ninety-five
She don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

Did you see that man
With the fat cigar?
He just left his lunch
With a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose a wine
From a vintage year
He will drink champagne
In his limousine
When the rest of us drink a beer

'Cause he's the man in the middle
Never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer
Not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle
Knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil
'Cause he wants to be
Man in the middle
The middle
The middle
In the middle...

But you see that man
Made a big mistake
Even though he's got
All his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too
All that he can't spend
He can buy the most
Nearly anything
But he can't buy in on his friend

'Cause he's the man in the middle
Never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer
Not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle
Knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil
'Cause he wants to be
Man in the middle
The middle
The middle
In the middle... 
No smiles, not a single word
At the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I wanna say
But I feel unable
You leave and you slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other
Through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take
That never comes back again
You and me
To the end

Outside I can see the sun
Through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening?
Where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like crying

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other
Through the hard times
One man, one woman
The one life to live together
One chance to take
That never comes back again
You and me
To the end

Daydreams of a better life
But I have to wake up
The sound of a key in the door
You smile and I realise
That we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other
Through the hard times
One man, one woman
The one life to live together
One chance to take
That never comes back again
You and me
To the end
You and me
To the end
Summer night city
Summer night city

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breath and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park
Summer night city

It's elusive
Call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow
When it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream
It's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park
Summer night city
They passed me by
All of those great romances
You were, I felt
Robbing me
Of my rightful chances
My picture clear
Everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different
I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead (no one else is achin' with a heart that's breakin')
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself
Feeling stupid
Feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Just like a child
Stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed
And I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead (no one else is achin' with a heart that's breakin')
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself
Feeling stupid
Feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all
Never left at all

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead (no one else is achin' with a heart that's breakin')
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself
Feeling stupid
Feeling small
Wishing
Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy 

Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey
The way that you kiss good night
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing 

I don't wanna hurt you baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be 

Honey honey, touch me baby, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, hold me baby, a-ha, honey honey
You look like a movie star (look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are (I wonder just who you are)
And honey, to say the least, you're a doggone beast 

So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high

There's no other place in this world where I rather would be 

Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before (I'd heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more (I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine Oh, you make me dizzy
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
What if I ain't worth the while?
Not the style you've been looking for?
If I'm sweet tonight
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud

I'm Carrie
Not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Would I be the one you seek?
Mild and meek like the girl next door?
Don't you realise
I may be an angel in disguise?
It's lonely to be free
But I'm not a man's toy
I'll never be

I'm Carrie
Not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

I don't believe in fairy tales
Sweet nothings in my ear (no no-no nothings, no no-no nothings)
But I do believe in sympathy
That's me, you see

Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Won't you have a drink with me?
Just to see you're not really sore?
I can't help my ways
I'm just not the girl to hide my face

I'm Carrie
Not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me
I'm Carrie
Not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

There's a special love
Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
If I keep on searching
But until then

I'm Carrie
Not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me 
Every day in the morning on her way to the office
You can see her as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree
'Cause I know she's got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be... 

Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waiting for
Just like Cinderella (just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day 

So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost never-ending stream
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain
Everybody seems to think she's a bore
But they wouldn't know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store... 

Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waiting for
Just like Cinderella (just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
She would like to play it every day
You say she's been mad at you
Then you say you'll be patient, hmm
Still I see that she makes you blue
Come on, I'll give you consolation 

Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna bring you some light
Wanna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna make it alright
You're all I ever need, my darling 

Just to be where you wanna be
So much fun we could have then, hmm
To be yours for eternity
What a miracle to happen 

Gonna sing you my lovesong, wanna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Wanna sing you my lovesong, when I think about you
I know she doesn't make it easy
'Cause you don't please her like you please me 

You're my love, you're my angel
You're my first, you're my last
Would she care if you lingered
For another night
Wanna hold you tight
We could make it right 

Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna bring you some light
Wanna make you feel happy every day of your life
Gonna sing you my lovesong, gonna make it alright
I know she doesn't make it easy

Gonna sing you my lovesong, wanna sing it for you
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too
Wanna sing you my lovesong, when I think about you
You're all I ever need, my darling
And I would love to sing my lovesong
For you
Half past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside my window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! A man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see
No one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Ah-a-ah-a-a-a-aah.. 

Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road that we're going (on the road)
We all need words of comfort and compassion (we all need)
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, that's the only way 

I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying
Ah-a-ah-a-a-a-aah.. 

Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
You might need his help one day (he's your brother)
We depend on one another (brother)
Love him, that's the only way

On the road that we're going (on the road that we're going)
We all need words of comfort and compassion (we all need)
Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
Love him, that's the only way 

Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
You might need his help one day (he's your brother)
We depend on one another (brother)
Love him, that's the only way
Suzy was nine and I was ten
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men
She used to follow us from school
We really thought that she was a little fool
And one day we said to her
We don't wanna hurt you girl
But you better 

Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around 

Suzy went home to mama's arms
Mama said, 'Look, she's never done you no harm!
So get off her back and let her be
Why can't you play together in harmony?'
We really didn't know what to say
But as soon as she went away
We laughed and said 

Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around 

Yes, you better
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around
They came from the hills
And they came from the valleys and the plains
They struggled in the cold
In the heat and the snow and in the rain
Came to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

Sub luna saltamus

They came from the south
From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man
Like a parish is waiting for the priest
Longed to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

Sub luna saltamus

He gave them a dream
He seduced everybody in the land
The fire in his eyes
And the fear was a weapon in his hand
So they let him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon
And we dance beneath the moon
I work all night, I work all day
To pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad?
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad?
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world 
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high (I can fly)
I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, High
What a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high (I can fly)
I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, High
What a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas

And to go anywhere that I please
People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand 

Man has always wanted a woman by his side to keep him company
Women always knew that it takes a man to get matrimonial harmony
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down wants some female sympathy
Gotta have love to carry on living
Gotta have love 'till eternity 

People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand 

La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la laa... 

Flowers in the desert need a drop of rain like a woman needs her man
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon, then he'll take it down if he can
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares, isn't that what you call a friend?
Gotta have love to carry on living
Isn't it easy to understand 

People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand 

La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la laa...
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby, by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you? 

Yes, I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh 

Ring ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring ring, why don't you give me a call? 

You where here and now you're gone
Hey did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is aching 

Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh 

Ring ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring ring, why don't you give me a call? 
He
Stands
Towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells
Me
I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry?

He's (he's)
Dressed (dressed)
In the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives (gives)
Me (me)
Of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me, I get so tired
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (all I see is)
All I see is a big balloon (big balloon)
Halfway up to the moon (halfway to the moon)
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry?

Strange (strange)
How (how)
Dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No (no)
More (more)
Pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on
I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry?

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size (all I see is)
All I see is a big balloon (big balloon)
Halfway up to the moon (halfway to the moon)
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh (so should I laugh)
Or cry?
Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine?
Where did it go?
I just don't know
But still my love for you will live forever 

Hasta ma&#241;ana 'till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Ma&#241;ana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta ma&#241;ana baby, hasta ma&#241;ana until then 

Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared
Where did they go?
I just don't know
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you 

Hasta ma&#241;ana 'till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Ma&#241;ana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta ma&#241;ana baby, hasta ma&#241;ana until then 

Hasta Ma&#241;ana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta ma&#241;ana baby, hasta ma&#241;ana until then
The city is a jungle
You better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe it
You better beware
Of me

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never go near me
I am the tiger

The city is a nightmare
A horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner
And try not to scream
It's me

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never go near me
I am the tiger

Yellow eyes
Are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes
The spotlights of the city nights

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never go near me
I am the tiger

The city is a prison
You never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows
And you'll see the shape of me

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never go near me
I am the tiger

Yellow eyes
Are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes
The spotlights of the city nights

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never go near me
I am the tiger

And if I meet you
What if I eat you?
I am the tiger
I am behind you
I'll always find you
I am the tiger
Tiger
Tiger
Tiger 
You move like a flame of fire
You rise like a flash of lightning
You light such a warm desire
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing
You better watch out
I said you better watch out 

Watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you
Watch out
I'll be staying close behind you
And I'm tired of waiting (ooh-a-la-la)
Yes, it's driving me crazy (ooh-a-la-la-la)
And my patience is fading (ooh-a-la-la)
Oh, you better watch out
I said you better watch out 

You sneak in, you're funny lately
You act like I was a stranger
I think you're beginning to hate me
But then you're a girl in danger
You better watch out
Ooh, I said you better watch out 

Watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you
Watch out
I'll be staying close behind you
And I'm tired of waiting (ooh-a-la-la)
Yes, it's driving me crazy (ooh-a-la-la-la)
And my patience is fading (ooh-a-la-la)
So you better watch out
Yes, I said you better watch out
Watch out 

Watch out
And I'm tired of waiting (ooh-a-la-la)
Yes, it's driving me crazy (ooh-a-la-la-la)
And my patience is fading (ooh-a-la-la)
I said you better watch out
Oh girl, you better watch out
Ha! You better watch out
Ooh, ah, you better watch out
I am just a girl, one among the others, nothing much to say
Plain and simple girl, not a special type in any way
Just one look, and you will surely see
That the true Miss Nobody is me
It's an evil world that has only made me a girl 

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl 

It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he says he loves you, and life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say 

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl 

La la la la la, la la la la la-la, la la la la laa
La la la la la, la la la la la-la, la la laa
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl 
Where are those happy days?
They seem so hard to find
I try to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good 

So when you're near me
Darling can't you hear me?
S.O.S
The love you gave me
Nothing else can save me
S.O.S
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I carry on? 

You seem so far away
Though you are standing near
You made me feel alive
But something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love
It used to be so good 

So when you're near me
Darling can't you hear me
S.O.S
The love you gave me
Nothing else can save me
S.O.S
When you're gone
How can even I try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I carry on? 

So when you're near me
Darling can't you hear me
S.O.S
And the love you gave me
Nothing else can save me
S.O.S
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I carry on?
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I carry on?
Tried to sneak out without saying
With my loudest record playing
Ooh, my mama said, 'Look at this, you haven't done your bed'
My mama said, 'That's a thing that you should do instead' 

Then I did what she had told me
Dying for my friend to hold me
Ooh, my mama said, 'Try and get one thing into your head' My mama said, 'Pa and me, we give you room and bed'
How I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life 

In the morning she said, 'Listen,'
Ooh, I felt like in a prison
Yeah, my mama said, 'I know you've been out again with Fred' (my mama said)
My mama said, 'Don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red' (my mama said)
Oh, I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life 

I said, 'I can't live without it'
'How I wish you wouldn't doubt it'
Ooh, my mama said, 'If you wanna hurt me go ahead' (my mama said)
My mama said, 'I suppose you'd rather see me dead?' (my mama said)
Oh, I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life

La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house
Tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends
This is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
We just have to face it
This time we're through (this time we're through, this time we're through, this time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know
But I have to go (I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Memories, good days, bad days (memories, good days, bad days)
They'll be with me always (they'll be, with me, always)
In these old familiar rooms
Children would play
Now there's only emptiness
Nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you (a-ha)
We just have to face it
This time we're through (this time we're through, this time we're through, this time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know
But I have to go (I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
I can hear how you work, practicing hard
Playing night and day
And it sounds better now, Yes you improve
Every time you play
But it's bad
You're so sad
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin

Dum dum diddle
To be your fiddle
To be so near ya
And not just hear ya
Dum dum diddle
To be your fiddle
I think then maybe
You'd see me, baby
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time

Wish I was
Dum dum diddle
Your darling fiddle

But I think you don't know that I exist
I'm the quiet kind
From the day when I first listened to you
You've been on my mind
You don't care
It's not fair
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin

Dum dum diddle
To be your fiddle
To be so near ya
And not just hear ya
Dum dum diddle
To be your fiddle
I think then maybe
You'd see me, baby
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time

Dum dum diddle
To be your fiddle
To be so near ya
And not just hear ya
Dum dum diddle
To be your fiddle
I think then maybe
You'd see me, baby
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was
Dum dum diddle
Your darling fiddle 
Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days 

I remember all the games we used to play
I really do
And I went to see them almost every day
I wanted to
Though we quarrelled at times
And had a few fights
We were the best of friends
We found a place in the sun
To have enough fun 

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climb in the apple tree
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days 

They would take me out for football games and such
They liked to play
And I guess I didn't like it very much
But anyway
I was happy and proud to be with the boys
Being a little girl
I found a place in the sun
To have enough fun 

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climb in the apple tree
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days
I've seen it on your face
Tells me more than any worn-out old phrase
So now we'll go separate ways
Never again we two
Never again, nothing I can do

Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (see it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words you try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only

I've watched you look away
Tell me, is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through

Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (see it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words you try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only 
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned
Has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied
I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned
Has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
So at last you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry?
Does it hurt when they ask for daddy? 

Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone? (Yes, you can) 

So you're free at last (lucky woman)
And beginning to forget the past (lucky woman)
Does it make you sad (being lonely)
When you think about the life you had?
But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom 

Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone?

Hey, hey Helen
What's the matter with you? (hey, hey Helen)
Hey, hey Helen (hey, hey Helen) 
Don't you know what to do? (Yes, you do)

A-ha, yes you do, yes, you do
A-ha, yes you do, yes, you do 

Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone?
Hey, hey Helen (hey, hey Helen)
What's the matter with you?
Hey, hey Helen (hey, hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do?
Hey, hey Helen (hey, hey Helen)
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen (hey, hey Helen) Can you make it alone
Rock me
Give me that kick now
Rock me
Show me that trick now
Roll me
You can do magic, baby
And I can't get enough of it
Rock me
Give me that feeling
Roll me
Rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it
Don't stop doing it now
(Don't stop the rock
Don't stop the rock
I said don't stop the rock)

Wanna be, wanna be
In my baby's arms
Gonna be, gonna be
Nice and gentle if you want me to
Just as long as I'm in love with you
Yours forever, honey, that's what I
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, yeah

Rock me
Give me that kick now
Rock me

Don't stop the rock
I said don't stop the rock)

Wanna be, wanna be
With the one that I love, love, love
Gonna be, gonna be
With you baby every single night
I can teach you how to rock alright
Your sweet lover, honey, that's what I
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, yeah 
Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it, so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much?
Sweet sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender?

Like a bang-a-boome-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang-a-boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang-a-boome-boomerang is love
A boome-boomerang is love

Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing

Yes, a bang-a-boome-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang-a-boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang-a-boome-boomerang is love

And if you're warm and tender
I'll kiss you, return to sender
Please surrender
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen 
Now there's a shadow falling
Over our faces
Doubt
Forever
In our hearts
And in a while we'll start to
Pick up the traces
We
Won't
Find the missing parts
Buy me a ticket I'll go to the Bahamas (aah)
I need a rest from our petty little dramas (aah)
Yes, I really do

Aha, hmm (now look what you've done)
Look what you've done
I'm missing all the fun (I miss all the fun)
Baby, you owe me one
Aha, hmm (it's my turn to run)
My turn to run
A chance to feel the sun (and sit in the sun)
Baby, you owe me one

I wasn't ready for this
Kind of intrusion
I
Was
Taken by surprise
Now both of us are in a
State of confusion
Hesitation
In our eyes
Something unwanted has entered our existence (aah)
I think it's better to view it from a distance (aah)
Yes, I really do

Aha, hmm (now look what you've done)
Look what you've done 
I'm missing all the fun (I miss all the fun)
Baby, you owe me one
Aha, hmm (it's my turn to run)
My turn to run
A chance to feel the sun (and sit in the sun)
Baby, you owe me one
Put on your white sombrero
Saddle your horse my dear
And ride off into the sunset
You better go
For there is no
Place for you here
Like an old-fashioned hero
You stand before me
Oh, you think our life is a movie
My world is real
I even feel
And I can do
Without you

Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandana too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye my friend
This is the end
For me and you
Now be a bold vaquero (quero, quero, quero, quero, quero)
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing (I will cry while you're disappearing)
Into the night
All dressed in white
Unchained and free
Without me

Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Go find a sweet se&#241;orita
Somebody meek
Who'll never speak
Harshly to you
You're such a caballero (caballero, caballero, caballero)
Proud
Never bending
I want someone who will take me (I want someone who will take me)
Just as I am
I need a man
Who is in rhyme
With his time
Oh, you never take me
Just as I am
I need a man
Who is in rhyme
With his time
Sitting in the darkest corner
In the candle light I saw her face (she was looking so sad and lonely)
Someone help me, someone save me
I could see the look she gave me, oh (oh yeah, and there was one thing only)
That I knew I could do 

Let's go girl
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
Let's go now
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band 

You've been sitting there for hours
Trying to hide behind the flowers now (baby, we could have fun together)
Come on, cheer up, let's get started
No use being broken-hearted now (oh yeah, you're gonna feel much better)
Yes, I know that you will 

Let's go girl
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
Let's go now
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
Come to my loveland
Wander along beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs
Come to the sunshine, beaches and the sand
Listen to two bluebirds, won't you come to my land?
The grass is mellow and the sky is blue
My paradise is waiting here for you 

It's a tropical loveland
I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny, happy and sunny
In my tropical loveland 

Come to my loveland (to my loveland)
Wander with me (to my loveland) Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree (to my loveland)
Over the rainbow (to my loveland) Under the moon (to my loveland)
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?
Just take my hand, I'll show you everything
The secrets that my paradise can bring 

It's a tropical loveland
I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny, happy and sunny
In my tropical loveland 

It's a tropical loveland
I wanna share it with you (I wanna share it with you)
It's a tropical loveland (It's a tropical loveland)
I wanna share it with you
It's a tropical loveland
I wanna share it with you
My my
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself 

Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo 

My my
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose 

Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo 

So how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose 

Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo
I, I've been in love before
I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still, strange as it seems to be
You brought it back to me
That old feeling

I, I don't know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me

You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I've been waiting for
I love you, I adore you
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems
My lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you

I, I'm gonna make you mine
You're gonna feel so fine
You'll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
Please, believe me

You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I've been waiting for
I love you, I adore you
I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me
More and more
And finally it seems
My lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well, I understand
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?

Nights can be empty, and nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome
I was blue
I couldn't help it
It had to be you
And I always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are Beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired you throw 'em away
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?

Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome
I was blue
I couldn't help it
It had to be you
And I always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are Beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me
Day is dawning and I must go
You're asleep but still I'm sure you'll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along 

Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Look in my restless soul, a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations 

When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
For a no-good bum like me
To live is to be free 

Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Look in my restless soul, a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations 
I have a dream
A song to sing
To help me cope
With anything
If you see the wonder
Of a fairy tale
You can take the future
Even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I have a dream
A fantasy
To help me through
Reality
And my destination
Makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness
Still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I have a dream
A song to sing
To help me cope
With anything
If you see the wonder
Of a fairy tale
You can take the future
Even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
Here's to us
One more toast
And then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside
Both us
Can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage
You and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over
And the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame
When all is said and done

In our lives
We have walked
Some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn
But dignified
And not too old for sex
We're still striving
For the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love
And thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame
When all is said and done

It's so strange
When you're down
And lying on the floor
How you rise
Shake your head
Get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads
No desire to run
There's no hurry anymore
When all is said and done

Standing calmly at the crossroads
No desire to run
There's no hurry anymore
When all is said and done
Changing, moving in a circle
I can see your face in all of my dreams
Smiling, laughing, from the shadows
When I hear your voice I know what it means
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try
You're all the reason for my life
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me 

How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have 

Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd
Thinking, wondering, what you're doing
I can't stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then, they'd never shared our love
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me 

How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have
This park and these houses
Old streets I have walked
Everything dear
Will it be here
One day when I am returning?

My friends will get married
Have children and homes
It sounds so nice
Well-planned and wise
Never expecting surprises

I wonder
It's frightening
Leaving now
Is that the right thing?
I wonder
It scares me
But who the hell am I
If I don't even try?
I'm not a coward
Oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes, I will take t
It can't go wrong

My friends and my family
This dull little town
Buses I've missed
Boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar

I wonder
It's frightening
Leaving now
Is that the right thing?
I wonder
Oh, it scares me
But who the hell am I
If I don't even try?
I'm not a coward
Oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes, I will take it
It can't go wrong 
I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face
That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries (this boy cries) 

I saw it in the mirror, my head is hanging low
And I ain't too familiar with the feelings that I show
I know you say you love me, but I'm looking through your lies
It doesn't really bother you if this boy cries (this boy cries) 

I never thought I could cry for you
But honey, I will miss you 'till the day I die ('till the day I die) 

I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face
That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries (this boy cries, this boy cries) 
I believe
Your new girl turned you down
And they say
she's pushin' you around
How does it feel
I guess it hurts your pride
Tell me, my friend
How many nights you've cried

Disaster and disgrace
The king has lost his crown
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
Aah
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown

Was it hard
To step down from your throne
And to know
Tonight you're all alone
Oh, what a shame
You really want that girl
She doesn't care
Still you just dream of her

Disaster and disgrace
The king has lost his crown
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown

Disaster and disgrace
The world is all around
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
Aah
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room 
Love me or leave me
Make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

I can't conceal it
Don't you see?
Can't you feel it?
Don't you too?
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I've just made it
I found you at last
So come on
Now let's try it
I love you
Can't deny it
'Cause it's true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it
But just wait and see
You and I
Can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do

And after fights
And words of violence
We'll make up with each other
The way old friends do

Times of joy
And times of sorrow
We will always see it through, oh

I don't care
What comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do

We can face it together
The way old friends do
