People look to me and say
Is the end near, when is the final day?
What's the future of mankind?
How do I know, I got left behind

Everyone goes through changes
Looking to find the truth
Don't look at me for answers
Don't ask me
I don't know

How am I supposed to know
Hidden meanings that will never show
Fools and prophets from the past
Life's a stage and we're all in the cast

You gotta believe in someone
Asking me who is right
Asking me who to follow
Don't ask me
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

Nobody ever told me
I found out for myself
You gotta believe in foolish miracles
It's not how you play the game
It's if you win or lose
You can choose, don't confuse, win or lose
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you
Go, go, go

People look to me and say
Is the end near, when is the final day?
What's the future of mankind?
How do I know, I got left behind, now I'm lost

Everyone goes through changes
Looking to find the truth
Don't look at me for answers
Don't ask me
I don't know

All aboard! Hahaha

Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe. it's not too late
To learn how to love, and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I've listened to preachers,
I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah

Heirs of a cold war,
that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles,
I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

Yesterday has been and gone
Tomorrow will I find the sun
Or will it rain
Everybody's having fun
Except me, I'm the lonely one
I live in shame

I say goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

I've been the king, I've been the clown
Now broken wings can't hold me down
I'm free again
The jester with the broken crown
It won't be me this time around
To love in vain

I say goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

And I feel the time is right
Although I know that you just might say to me
What'cha gonna do
What'cha gonna do
But I have to take this chance goodbye
To friends and to romance
And to all of you
And to all of you
Come on now

I say goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

And the weather's looking fine
And I think the sun will shine again
And I feel I've cleared my mind
All the past is left behind again

I say goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liqueur
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows
Away tomorrows

Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the master keeper

'Cos you feel life's unreal, and you're living a lie
Such a shame, who's to blame, and you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask, is there life after birth
What you saw can mean hell on this earth
Hell on this earth

Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's travelling at full throttle
It's catching you, but you don't see
The reaper's you, and the reaper is me

Breaking laws, knocking doors
But there's no one at home
Made your bed, rest your head
But you lie there and moan
Where to hide, suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liqueur
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows

Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk with the dead?
Your life style to me seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
Yeah, you waited on Satan's door

Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure?
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred
Manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth

Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic, of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maiden's call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall

Was it polemically sent
l want to know what you meant
I want to know, I want to know what you meant, yeah

Silver screen, such a disgrace
I couldn't look her straight in the face
A blue addiction I live in disgust
Degradation, being eaten by lust

No bone movies
No bone movies
No bone movies

Inspiration that's blue and uncut
Can't kick the habit, obsession of smut
Voyeur straining, in love with his hand
A poison passion, a pulsating gland

No bone movies
No bone movies
No bone movies

I shouldn't do it, the guilt tells me why
I just can't stop it, I try and I try
X-rated demon that lives in my head
Hungry for bodge, and he wants to be fed

No bone movies
No bone movies
No bone movies

No, no, no bone movies
No, no, no bone movies
No, no, no bone movies

Mother please forgive them
For they know not what they do
Looking back in history's books
It seems it's nothing new
Oh, let my mother live

Heaven is for heroes
And hell is full of fools
Stupidity, no will to live
They're breaking God's own rules
Please let my mother live

Father of all creation
I think we're all going wrong
The path they're taking
Seems to be breaking
And it won't take too long
Children of the future
Watching empires fall
Madness, the cup they drink from
Self destruction, the toll

I had a vision, l saw the world burn
And the seas had turned red
The sun had fallen, the final curtain
In the land of the dead
Mother, please show the children
Before it's too late
To fight each other, there's no one winning
We must fight all the hate

Now I feel the time is right
Love will flow like wine tonight
Give your love and it will come to you, yeah
If you feel that you and me
Could escape and hold the key
To a paradise that's true and free, yeah

Steal away
Steal away
Steal away the night

You gotta steal it, come on baby

Now I've met your honesty
You are here and I am free
Broken chains have fallen all around, yeah
Point my finger at the fools
Broken chains and broken rules
Let it be rebellion rules tonight, yeah

Steal away
You gotta steal away
Steal away the night

Could it be a dream come true
Now that I am here with you?
Tearful eyes of joy is something new, yeah
Run away with me tonight
Dream the dream and light the light
Happiness is what you give to me, yeah

Steal away
Steal away
You gotta steal away the night

Steal away
Steal away
You gotta steal away the night

Steal away
Steal away
Steal away the night

Pictures building in my head
Nothing done and nothing said
Talking to me with your eyes
What they say is no surprise
Things are so much different now
But nothing lasts forever

You, looking at me, looking at you
I wanna talk to you
You, looking at me, looking at you

Carry on from day to day
Even when we touch it seems miles away
I know you know I know too
Is it me or is it you?
Things are so much different now
But nothing lasts forever

I had a dream that we were through
I can't imagine nights without you, yeah
Looks and fixes can we repair
Talking good and we just stare
Waste of love is waste of life
Save our love from the final knife
Things would be so different then
Our love would last forever

Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengence is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Ha ha ha ha ha...

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon

They cursed and buried him along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
In empty burning hell - unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong (so wrong)
Ooh, yeah baby

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon
Oh Oh yeah, bark at the moon

How many times can you put me down 
'Till in your heart you realize
If you chose to criticise you choose your enemies

Everything that I say and do
In your eyes is always wrong
Tell me where do I belong in a sick society

Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me

Look at yourself instead o' looking at me
With accusation in your eyes
Do you want me crucified for my profanity

Concealing your crimes behind a grandeur of lies
Tell me where do I begin
If you think you're without sin be the first to cast the stone

Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me
Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me

Can't you see, can't you see
Your're no different to me
Won't you see, won't you see
You're no different to me

Living my life in a way that I choose
You say I should apologize
Is that envy in your eyes reflecting jealousy

Tell me the truth and I'll admit to my guilt
If you'll try and understand
Is that blood that's on your hand from your democracy

Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me
Your're no different to me, yeah
Your're no different, no different to me

Overbearing woman makin' it so hard for me
Now you've laid it down for all to see, yeah
Can I ask a question, d'ya think that you can take a blow
This is why I always come and go, yeah

Now you see it, now you don't, yeah
Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music, take it like a man, yeah
Givin' it to me anyway that you can, yeah

Everybody's feeling everything you've got to feel
I've got something that you can't conceal

Now you see it, now you don't, yeah
Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music, take it like a man, yeah
Givin' it to me anyway that you can

Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't

Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't

Give me central heating, hope that I can pay the bill
Making me forget my fear of hell, yeah
Must be luck in odd numbers, now you face me upside down
I'm so far up, I'm afraid to come back down, yeah

Now you see it, now you don't, yeah
Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music, take it like a man, yeah
Givin' it to me anyway that you can

They couldn't see what I thought would be so obvious
They hide behind the laws they made for all of us
The ministry of truth that deals with pretense
The ministry of peace that sits on defense
I'm washing my hands of what they're trying to do
It's for me, it's for me, it's for you, it's for you

I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say I worship the devil
They must be stupid or blind
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel

They live a life of fear and insecurity
And all you do is pay for their prosperity
The ministry of fear that won't let you live
The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive
Do what you will to try and make me conform
I'll make you wish that you had never been born

Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll do what I please
Yes I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
And I'm as free as the breeze
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel

They'll try playin' win your heart
They know it rules your head
If they could read between the lines
You know they'd see the real day

God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious
Is it because they manifest the incubus
The ministry of war that got caught in the draft
The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed
When it's all boiled down and the day's at an end
I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend

Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say I worship the devil
Why don't they open their eyes
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel
A rock 'n' roll rebel
I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel

There's no present, there's no future
I don't even know about the past
It's all timeless and neverending
And for me to think it's all too vast

It goes forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity

The time is coming, but also going
And it's leaving never to return
It may be heaven, could be forever
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn

It goes forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity

I've got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavor
Forever is a long, long time

There's no secrets and no corruption
In the centre of infinity
There's no limits to non-existence
And no beginning to my destiny

It goes forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity

Time has come to say goodbye
I know it's gonna make you cry
But you belong to another my love
And half a love, that just isn't enough

I am so tired (so tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired (so tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through, yeah

I've waited all this time for you
Believed your promises were true
I keep believing that you mean what you say
Be my tomorrow, now tomorrow's today

I am so tired (so tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired (so tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through, yeah

And I often sit and wonder why
You're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remaining true
While you do what you want to do, yeah

And I often sit and wonder why
You're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remaining true
While you do what you want to do

I am so tired (so tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired (so tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through, yeah

So tired, so tired
So tired, so tired
So tired, so tired, yeah

I'll never bother keeping up with you
Burning the candle at both ends, it's true
You know the writing's on the wall
Why do you ride to take a fall

Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down, and join the human race, yeah

I tried to tell you time and time again
You know you'll have to pay the consequence
Now you're obsessed with such a pace
But slow and steady wins the race

Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down, and join the human race, yeah

You seem to run around and 'round in vain
People are saying that you've gone insane
Tell me just what you're running from
One day you're here, the next you're gone

Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down, and join the human race

Waiting for darkness
Why doesn't anybody see, now
Deafened by silence
Why doesn't anybody hear

I'm waiting for darkness

Playing with fire
But they're screaming when they're burned, yeah
Out of the sunlight
Hasn't anybody learned

I know what they'll find
It's in their mind
It's what they want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the night
And here I'll stay

Waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness

Promise me rebirth
And then you tear me from the womb
Give me my freedom
And then you lock me in a tomb

I know what they'll find
It's in their mind
It's what they want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the night
And here I'll stay

Waiting for darkness
You gotta believe
You gotta believe it's true
I'm waiting for darkness
I just can't conceive
Why darkness is overdue

I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness

Who knows the answers
Is it friend or is it foe
Don't ask me questions
There are things you should not know

I know what you'll find
It's in your mind
It's what you want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the night
And here I'll stay

Waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness
I'm waiting for darkness

Spiders in the night
Creeping round the walls
Now you'll feel him
Crawling over you

Creepy crawly things
Filling up your bed
Soon you'll feel him
Crawling through your brains

You think he's there
Beware his bite
But when you look
The spider's not in sight

Spiders reappear
Taking peoples names
Everything is taken down insane

There's no way out
And there's no key
But here's a clue
The spider's really me

You're written in his book
The spider won't forget
You won't forget
The spiders in the night

The end is going night
Itsy witsy friends
The spiders disappearing from the night

You think he's gone
You think he's dead
There's no escape
The spiders in your head

All the spiders in the night
All the spiders in the night
All the spiders in the night

Would you like some sweeties little girl?
Come a little closer
I'm gonna show you a brand new world tonight
I've got a palace full of fantasy
Ready made just for you and me
Once you're there I'm gonna take you for a ride
I got a one way ticket
To take you to the other side
I got a one way ticket
So come along and don't be shy
They call Mr. Tinker Train
That's how I got to get my name
They call me Mr. Tinker Train
So come along and play my game
You'll never be the same
Close the curtains and turn out the lights
Beneath my wing it's gonna be alright
A little secret just for you and me
I've got the kind of toys you've never seen
Manmade and a bit obscene
Little angel come and sit upon my knee

Mr. Tinker Train
Nevr be the same
Mr. Tinker Train ...................
Can you say Mr. Tinker Train?
No use crying 'cause you can't go back
Now you're here to stay
You can't run, you can't hide
You can't tell me what I feel inside
Mr. Tinker Train
What's how I go to get my name
They call me Mr. Tinker Train
So come along and play my game
That's why they call me Mr. Tinker Train

Standing at the crossroads, world spinning round and round
Know which way I'm going, you can't bring me down
Don't you try and teach me no original sin
I don't need your pity for the shape I'm in
I Don't Wanna Chaneg The World
I don't want the world to change me
I Don't Wanna Chaneg The World
I don't want the world to change me
Tell me I'm a sinner I got news for you
I spoke to God this morning and he don't like you
You telling all the people the original sin
He says he knows you better that you'll ever know him

You know it ain't easy
You know it ain't fair
So don't try to please me
Because I really don't care
Don't tell me stories 'cause yesterday's glories
Have gone away, so far away
I've heard it said there's a light up ahead
Lord I hope and pray I'm here to stay
Tell me I'm a sinner I got news for you
I sspoke to God this morning and he don't like you
Don't you try and teach me no original sin
I don't need your pity for the shape I'm in

Times have changed and times are strange
Here I come, but I ain't the same

Mama, I'm coming home

Times gone by, seems to be
You could have been a better friend to me

Mama, I'm coming home

You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah, you had me hypnotized
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

You made me cry, you told me lies
But, I can't stand to say goodbye

Mama, I'm coming home

I could be right, I could be wrong
It hurts so bad, it's been so long

Mama, I'm coming home

Selfish love, yeah, we're both alone
The ride before the fall, yeah.
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone
I just got to have it all.

I've seen your face a hundred times,
Everyday we've been apart
I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
'cause mama,

Mama, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah, you had the hypnotised, yeah.
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

I've seen your face a thousand times
Everyday we've been apart
And I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
'cause mama,

Mama, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

I always knew what I wanted to be
I knew for sure, I knew for sure
Always knew it was them or me
I wanted more, more and more
It's alright, it's OK
None of them people gonna take it away
They don't know like I know
And I can't stop 'cause it drives them crazy
It drives them crazy, 'cause I won't be cool
It's too late baby
It's the same old desire
Nothing has changed, nothing the same
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain
Always moving, somewhere else to be
Moving on, moving on
Scream at you and you scream at me
Right or wrong, right or wrong
It's alright, it's OK
No one's ever gonna take us away
'Cause they don't know, like I know
I gotta keep rocking, 'cause it makes me crazy
It makes me crazy, who needs to be cool
Life's amazing
It's the same old desire
Crazy train, crazy train
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain
Same old desire
Nothing has changed, nothing the same
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain
Oh, yeah
It's the same old desire
Nothing has changed, nothing the same
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain
Same old desire
Crazy train, crazy train
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain

The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack
Your momma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror tell me do you think your life's in danger here ya
No more tears
Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin
I see the man around the corner waiting does to see me ?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here
No more tears
So now that it's over can't we just say good-bye?
I'd like to move an and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold Idon't know what else to say
I never wanted it to end this way my love my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here
No more tears

A psycho driver twisted in my head
Silence broken, but there's nothing said
I got a nightmare from a fantasy
Will the voices ever set me free
I can hear'em, I can hear'em
Someone wake me when it's over
I can see'em, I can see'em
I can see'em over and over again
I saw it happening like deja-vu
They tried to tell me, but they couldn't get through
In my head I hear the voices scream
I need someone to tell me what it means

Whoa - Who turned off the lights ?
Whoa - A shadow in the night
Whoa - It wasn't meant to be
I can't tak this alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight
Oh no I can't take it alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight
Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass
I wonder if tonight will be my last
I need an angel who can rescue me
To save me from my mental symphony

Whoa - Who turned off the lights ?
Whoa - A shadow in the night
Whoa - It wasn't meant to be
I can't take this alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight
No, no I can't take it alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight

I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough

I keep saying that it's getting too much
But I know I'm a liar
Feeling all right
in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire

Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

Walking out on another stage
Another town, another place
Sometimes I don't feel right
Nerves wound up too damn tight

People keep telling me it's bad for my health
But kicking back don't make it
Out of control
I play the ultimate role
But that's what lights my fire

Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough

Feeling all right in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire

Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you

Time after time
I guess that love is blind
I couldn't read your mind
Line after line
Line after line
It was written in your eyes
I guess it's no surprise
Time after time
I can hear them whispering
Shadows in the rain
Thinking how it might have been
Time after time
Line after line, you broke me
Day after day
I watched love fade away
I wanted love to stay
Day after day
The games we play
The foolish things we say
The pain won't go away
Day after day
Candlelight are shimmering
Shadows on the wall
Thinking how it might have been

I don't need no doctor
But I need something to kill the pain
Don't know what I'm after
But the pressure driving me insane
Searching for a differnt ride
Had a funny feeling I can't hide
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Why can't they just let me be
Alone without the misery
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp
Flirting with disaster
Mornign after killing me again
Hiding from the laughter
And the demons dancing round my brain
Always dancing on thin ice
I guess I'll have to pay the price
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Thinking how it could have been
If I had never let them in
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp
Take me to the doctor
'Cause I feel it coming on again
Don't know where I'm going
'Cause I guess I don't know where I've been
Looking for a different ride
Always dancing on thin ice
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp
Thinking how it could have been
If I had never let them in
Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp

I get up and I get down
I don't know how to take it
All the pain makes me scream and shout
I wonder if I'll make it
I love the feeling when the magic is just right
There's no revealing what is hidden in the night
Riding on a train that I can't control
No one else to blame and I can't let go
In the darkness I can feel
The things that makes me crazy
Hands of madness cold as steel
I find it quite amazing
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know
Rules meant for breaking and the seeds I have to sow
Riding on a train that I can't control
No one else to blame and I can't let go
It's calling me, It's calling me
It's calling me, It's calling me
I'm riding on a train that I can't control
See no evil, fear no fright
Never lose the living
Keep the targets in your sight
Know the cards you're dealing
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know
Rules meant for breaking and I gotta let, I gotta it go

I was looking back on my life
And all the things I've done to me
I'm still looking for the answers
I'm still searching for the key
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
It just won't leave me alone
I still find it all a mystery
Could it be a dream?
The Road To Nowhere leads to me
Through all the happiness and sorrow
I guess I'd do it all again
Live for today and not tomorrow
It's still the road that never ends
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
It just won't leave me alone
I still find it all a mystery
Could it be a dream?
The Road To Nowhere leads to me
Ah Ah
The Road To Nowhere I gonna pass me by
Ah Ah
I hope the never have to say goodbye
I never want to live without you

The Road To Nowhere leads to me

Everybody knows all the highs and all the lows, 
And in that nothing ever goes right, 
It's not up to me if you look but you don't see, 
What could obviously be alright?

Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere baby
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere

It's a vision, not religion, 
And the truth is plain to see, 
It's a feeling, it's revealing, 
Nowhere you can hide, 
So don't blame me.

There's no guarantee what you get is what you see, 
Don't try to find it, just don't try, 
Don't try living in the past, if you want your dreams to last, 
Don't hide behind the mask of lies, 

Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere baby, 
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere

It's a vision, not religion, 
And the truth is plain to see, 
It's a feeling, it's revealing, 
So don't blame me

Deep inside of me, lives a hunger to be free, 
I know I'll have to pay the prize, 
I may never know when it comes or when it goes, 
I guess it's just a part of life?

Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere baby, 
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere, 

It's a vision, it's religion, 
And the truth is plain to see, 
It's a feeling, it's revealing, 
Nowhere you can hide, 
So don't blame me

Everywhere I go people always seem to know
Who I am and what I'm about
When they look to me I'm not really what they see
But in their minds there is no doubt

I'm goin' nowhere, I'm goin' nowhere baby
Nowhere baby
I'm goin' nowhere, I'm goin' nowhere

Television, superstition
Genicidal can not see
Politicians make decisions
They're the one's to blame
So don't blame me

Turn the channel when you see, now your big time on TV
But something that you'll never know
I'm just a simple man, gettin' by on what I can
My pastor's got me on the run

I'm goin' nowhere, I'm goin' nowhere baby
Nowhere baby
I'm goin' nowhere, I'm goin' nowhere

Television, superstition
Genicidal can not see
Politicians make decisions
They're the one's to blame
So don't blame me, don't blame me
Don't blame me, don't blame me

Everywhere I go people always seem they know
Who I am and what I'm about
When they look to me, I'm not really what they see
But in their minds there is no doubt

I'm goin' nowhere, I'm goin' nowhere baby
Nowhere baby
I'm goin' nowhere, I'm goin' nowhere

Television, superstition
Genicidal can not see
Politicians make decisions
They're the one's to blame
So don't blame me, don't blame me
Don't blame me, don't blame me
Don't blame me, don't blame me

Into the night I've gotta go
That's when the juices start to flow
Everything will be alright

I might be blind but I can see
I got the power inside of me
Everything will be alright

I'm never gonna crack under a witch's spell
Never put her chains on me
I'm never gonna break it, no I'll never tell
I know she'll never let me be

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed, no more

I like it fast, I like it slow
There's no direction I couldn't go
Everything will be alright

I like it loud, I like it mean
I got the thunder in my machine
Everything will be alright

Dancing with disaster is a part of me
I'm never gonna let it go
Don't know what I'm after I'm deserting me
The secret that I'll never know

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed, no more
No more, no more, yeah, baby, I like it girl
No more, no more, no more, yeah, baby, I like it girl

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed

I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the anti-christ or the iron man
I have a vision that I just can't control
I feel I've lost my spirit and sold my soul
Got no control

I try to entertain you the best I can
I wish I'd started walking before I ran
But I still love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop cause it gets me through yeah
It gets me through yeah

The feelings that I hide behind
Sometimes reality's unkind
The nightmares stalk for me at night
I dread the long and lonely nights

I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the anti-christ or the iron man
But I still love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop cause it gets me through yeah

I'm just trying live yeah
I'm just trying live yeah
I'm just trying live yeah
I'm just trying live yeah

You make promise of protection
To a future after life
To the final resurrection
And to eternal paradise

But then I'm blinded with temptation
And to every mortal sin
Is it God that sits there waiting?
Or will the darkness suck me in

Let's wake up the dead
Oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed
Oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell

Oh the children sit and listen
The belief was in their eyes
In a land without tomorrows
Through the night you hear their cries

But then your eyes just skip the pages
Of a book that never ends
Is it God that sits there waiting?
Do you hear the call again?

Let's wake up the dead
Oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed
Oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know
That I'm facing hell

It's just crazy world we live in
And I'm out of my mind
You pray tomorrow but your leaving today
Evil one is coming and he's knocking your door
Cause todays the day you'll pay

Let's wake up the dead
Oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed
Oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know

Let's wake up the dead
Oh yeah
It's better that never you know
More tears are shed
Oh yeah
I'm praying that you'll never know

That I'm facing hell
That I'm facing hell
That I'm facing hell
That I'm facing hell

Gazing through the window at the world outside
Wondering will mother earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime

After all there's only just the two of us
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself
Time after time

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days

I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those Who will come after us ...
This time

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days

Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really matter much to me
Without each others help there ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream of fantasy
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

If only we could all just find serenity
It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry ...
Be gone?

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away
Today
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days
Okay
I'm just a dreamer
Who's searching for the way
Today
I'm just a dreamer
Dreaming my life away
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Looking to the mirror
From the other side
Seeing her reflection
And it blows my mind
Trying to deny it
But damage is done
I'll just run as always
But the race is run

You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out

Read the daily fiction, Superman is dead
Crushing coins of silver, imitating lead (?)
Then if you will fix the children of the past (?)
I guess their's isn't welcome, doesn't time move fast (?)

You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out

Night in the shadow of man
This is the dawn of the dead
Don't let it live in your head
And then now as the sabbath begins
It wakes your nightmare again
So run away if you can
So just run
Run as fast as you can

You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out

Too late too tell me it's over now
Falling apart at the seams
No angel sits on my shoulders now
I hold my head and it screams
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out

All these tears I cry
Don't you wonder why
Is it all a dream
Never what it seems
Gets under my skin
Should I let you in
Don't you think it's bad
To give me something that I never had

Every word I say
Everytime I pray
Look into my eyes
Distant voices cry
Is there light in me
Tell me what you see
You are what I have
Can't get something that I never had
Can't get something that I never had

Should I think about tomorrow oh
Should I live for just today
Take the light that burns inside you
Let it burn away
Let it burn away
Let it burn away

Will I see the day
Will I have to pay
What's inside of me
You will never see
Won't you let me in
Don't you let me see
Do you think I'm bad
Cause I want something that I never had
Cause I want something that I never had

Give me something that I never had
Give me something that I never had

Tried to be your father
Things just made it harder
Sorry if I made you cry

Years turned you against me
Heart was always aching
And I never thought you'd say goodbye

I could have been wrong
You know
I should have been strong
You know

That'll do .... ha ha ha

You're coming down badly
You're crippled inside
A rat in your sewer
You've no place to hide
A gut wrenching fever
Addicted to death
You don't give a fuck
If it means your last breath

You try so hard to quit
But you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why
Cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie

You crave for the needle to stick in your vein
Can't wait for the poison to kill all the pain
You buy your cheap ticket to take a short ride
That beautiful flower is eating your mind

You try so hard to quit
But you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why
Cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie

Your name means nothing
You don't know the score
Body is aching you still crave for more
Sometimes you wish that you'd never been born
Tormenting came with a crown full of thorns

You're chasing the dragon
You're chasing the high
A bird with one wing
Who's still trying to fly
You're all out of spirit
A dead man alive
A born again junkie
You'll never survive

You try so hard to quit
But you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why
Cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie

Junkie
Junkie
Junkie
Junkie

Been around this world so many times
If you could only see my mind
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell

Faith alone has guided me
The ghost of my own destiny
I haven't even got a soul to sell

All the thing I put me through
I wouldn't wish my hell on you
You'll never know what's going on inside

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Trouble always seems find
A way to live inside my mind
My haunted head and me remain alone
Underneath my masquerade
A simple man who's so afraid
I try to find a light to guide me home

Momma please just hold me tight
Feeling so afraid tonight
Cause your the only one that really knows

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Fighting for my sanity
Many nights of tragedy
Got to leave my Wretched ways behind

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of fate and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Underneath my masquerade
a simple who's still afraid

You load the dice and paint the smile upon your face
With fingers crossed you switch the perfume with the mace
What kind of dreams to you enjoy inside your bed
I'll face the lies and shake the evil from your head

Black Illusion
Is all I ever see
Black Illusion
I bring you misery
oh yeah
yeah

You always seem to know the answer to it all
You seem to cheat the truth and never take the fall
Your life is hollow and you simply the rules
The time will come when you will join the other fools

Black Illusion
Is all I ever see
Black Illusion
I bring you misery
oh yeah
yeah

I load the dice and fake a smile upon my face
With fingers crossed I switch the perfume with the mace
What kind of dreams do I enjoy inside my bed
You'll face the lies and shake the evil from my head

Black Illusion
Is all I ever see
Black Illusion
I bring you misery
oh yeah
yeah

A child of a broken mind
The fear that I hide behind
I hate rejection
It's the worst
It gravely hurts me

Living inside my head
I feel like the living dead
I need your affection
It's the best
It greatly helps me

With my back against the wall
Trying so hard not to fall
I'm so tired of sleeping around
Hopeless, in despair
Don't know if I'm here or there
Feeling like I'm up and I'm down

But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
You know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here
But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
I don't want to die

A head full of tragic schemes
what keeps me alive is dreams
I dream that someday
I'll find the key that sets my mind free
You may think I've lost control
The man with the broken soul
I'm not here to try and make excuses
Just believe me

With my back against the wall
Trying so hard not to fall
I'm so tired of sleeping around
Hopeless, in despair
Don't know if I'm here or there
Feeling like I'm up and I'm down

But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
You know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
I don't want to die
yeah

But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
You know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here
But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
You know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here
But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
You know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here
But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere
You know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here
I don't want to die
You know I'm alive
You know I'm alive

So sick and tired of living
And so afraid to die
I've lived so many lives
And still I wonder why
The way the world perceives me
Is not the way I am
The one half thinks I'm crazy
The other thinks I'm mad

I spent a long long time alone in my room
I need your help to get me out of this gloom

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead
They freak me out

Ten thousand million nightmares
Temptation by the score
I used to get so high
And still I wanted more
You think my time is wasted
In search of who I am
I tried to so hard to kill
The boy inside the man

I spent a thousand years one night in my room
I've lived so many lives and that is my doom

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead
They freak me out

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead
They freak me out

I never thought I'd smile again
Always thought I'd be here on my own
Sometimes when I'm down
You come and save me again
And again
And again
And again

I'll never understand it
It makes no sense at all
Just look at what I've done
It's time to count the score

I've spent a long long time alone in my room
I need your help to get me out of this gloom

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead
They freak me out

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead
They freak me out

You must seduce me, the ties with fire
My one addiction, your sweet desire
Is living in a world of hate and dreams
Standing at the end of time
We had paradise but that was lost
Forever to mankind

No place for angels, for you and me
No place for angels, I'm lost in your reality,
Where life seems so unreal

I feel the madness, the Jesus liar
The one creation, obsessed by fire
We're, living in a world of hate and dreams
Standing at the end of time
We had paradise but that was lost
Forever to mankind

No place for angels, for you and me
No place for angels, I'm lost in your reality
Where life seems so unreal

You may think that I'm just a crazy guy
And I wear the madman's masks
Do I live my life in a fake disguise?
Is my world just caving in (ah)

No place for angels, for you and me
No place for angels, I'm lost in your reality
Where life seems so unreal

I'm a rock star,
I'm a dealer,
I'm a servant,
I'm a leader,
I'm a savior,
I'm a sinner,
I'm a killer,
I'll be anything you want me to be

Silent
As a witness,
Make your heart race
With a death kiss,
I'm a soldier
In a blood war
In the Peace Corps,
I am everything you'll ever be

A loser,
Number zero,
Play the victim,
End up a hero,
I'm a teacher,
Preacher,
Liar,
I am anything, everything

Mover
And a shaker,
The oppressor,
Stimulator,
I'm a coward,
I'm a fighter,
Yeah

From the useless,

Second guesses,
All dependent,
I'll do anything to help you

Modern science,
Open guest list,

The cold words deafen
and silence long forgotten
the logic never reclaimed

The anger rises
sometimes there's no surrender
no white flag flies
you won't like me when I'm angry

Stop talking to me
just like i don't even bleed
this cross is heavy when
you're my soul sucker
Get out of my face
the past is running in place
the silvers cut me as you
suck the soul right out of me

Soul sucker

Soul soul sucker
Soul soul sucker
You bite down deeper
your tongue can cut a heart out
you've passed the point of return

The storm lightens
get ready for the whiplash
don't think don't speak
don't, my patience turns to violence

I'm just a solitary man who wants to live
a quiet life before when i cease to exist
i don't need resistance for the things i can't control
just turn away and let it go

Soul soul sucker
Soul soul sucker

I watch it all change,
Take the news of the day
And throw it away

Time will kill all the pain,
Fate will cure the decay of all this blind ambition,
The greed brings us together

Stay strong,
Stay true,
Be brave,
It all comes down to you

Try to just let it go,
Know that justice moves slow,
But it comes in the end

Rise, the guilty will fall,
Stay, they can't take it all; they want the unimportant,
It's love they leave behind

Stand up,
Aim true,
Keep heart,
The future looks to you

Every second you throw away,
Every minute of every day,
Don't get caught in a memory,
'Cause life won't wait for you,
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

I'm watching the change,
Who will carry the flame?
It all feels very strange

Dreams that men can be good,
Faith to live as we should and know we're all connected,
We give ourselves the power

Stay strong,
Stay true,
Be brave,
It all comes down to you

Every day that you wait, you're falling faster,
No slight of hand,
No twist of fate,
No ever after

When it's gone, it's gone,
I'll fight 'til the bitter end,
Life won't wait for you,
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend
Life won't wait for you, my friend

You're saving the saved,
Men and women enslaved,
Propagating the messiah conception

The rich getting richer,
Paint you into their picture,
Give the poor immaculate deception

Where are you Father?
Why don't you save us?
The fallen are dying alone

How can you turn off their cries?
Ignore a new genocide?

So come on, Jesus,
We're all here waiting just for you

How long must we keep on waiting?
The faithful and blind are keepin' me, keepin' me down

How long? 'Cause my faith is breaking,
The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down

Do you live in the light
Or in the dead of the night?
Sanctimonious promises broken

Hypocritical sin,
Dying slowly within,
Is the sacred truth forever unspoken?

Life ever after,
Bohemian rapture,
Beware the dark side of the Son.

You're just a self-made messiah,
Selling brimstone and fire

So come on, Jesus,
Don't keep us waiting just for you

How long must we keep on waiting?
The faithful and blind are bringin' me, bringin' me down

How long? 'Cause my faith is breaking,
The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down

How will I know you, Mr. Jesus Christ?
Have you already been here once or twice?

The son of man are obsolete façade,
How will I know that you're the son of God?
Yeah

Give me your money,
I'll sell you my vote,
I promise I'll save you,
While I'm cutting your throat

You want to feel pleasure,
Look into my eyes,
I'm gonna swear on the bible
While I'm feeding you lies

My touch thickens your blood,
I know the things that you love,
My voice swallows the purest heartbeat

I'm your counterfeit friend,
I'll still be here 'til I crucify you,
I crucify you again

Give me your heroes,
Your sinners and saints,
A little temptation
Is all that it takes

I've been here forever,
I'm your oldest friend,
Until I pull on the trigger,
The fun never ends

My touch thickens your blood,
I know the things that you love,
My voice swallows the purest heartbeat

I'm your counterfeit friend,
I'll still be here 'til I crucify you,
I crucify you again

I've been around here for a long, long time,
I'll be around until your soul is mine,
Until your soul is mine

My touch thickens your blood,
I know the things that you love,
My voice swallows the purest heartbeat

I'm your counterfeit friend,
I'll still be here 'til I crucify you,
I crucify you again

No prayers left for heroes,
The dead won't see the ending,
War started by rich men
Won't stop the poor from dying

I'll grant you your death wish,
It's not just time I'm killing,
Blood's thicker than water,
It's too late to surrender

This will be your last stand,
I wash the blood from my hands

I am warrior,
I'm fearless

No Pain,
No mercy,
No weakness,
I, I, I'm fearless

I answer no questions,
You will obey my order,
I'll punish all sinners,
This battle has no borders

No saving salvation,
Your soul is stained and rusted,
I follow no leader,
My vigilante justice

I'd rather die on my feet
Than live a life on my knees

I am warrior,
I'm fearless

No Pain,
No mercy,
No weakness,
I, I, I'm fearless

My skin and bones drip off of me,
I'm more than man, more than machine

This will be your last stand,
I wash the blood from my hands

I am warrior,
I'm fearless

No Pain,
No mercy,
No weakness,
I, I...

I am warrior,
I'm fearless

No Pain,
No mercy,
No weakness,
I, I, I'm fearless

The time has come for you
To make up your own mind (mind),
Stop looking for the answers
That you'll never find

Save all your tears for when you
Really need to cry,
Don't wish your life away,
Just spread your wings and fly

Time waits for no one, yeah,
It's never what it seems,
Stop waiting for tomorrow,
Stop living in your dreams, yeah

This life fading away,
This life ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind

I know it's wasting away,
We don't plan for when it goes wrong,
The time that we lose,
We will never find time
(Time, time, time, time, time, time...)

Can't hide the clock
When every line shows on your face (face),
So take it slow,
You'll never win the human race

Time waits for no one, yeah,
Everything must change,
Stop running to the future,
Stop living for today

This life fading away,
This life ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind

I know it's wasting away,
We don't plan for when it goes wrong,
The time that we lose,
We will never find time

Just live every moment of each day,
'Cause death is the price we all must pay

(This life fading away),
This life ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind

I know it's wasting away,
We don't plan for when it goes wrong,
The time that we lose,
We will never find time

This life fading away,
This life ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind

I know it's wasting away,
We don't plan for when it goes wrong,
The time that we lose,
We will never find time
(Time, time, time, time, time, time...)

Life is not eternal,
It's sane and then a freak show,
It's all we have until it's all gone (all gone)

A split second can last forever,
No fortune can make it better,
One heartbeat just until the last one (last one)

Rung by rung on the ladder (ladder),
Don't slow down, only faster,
Knock yourself out; doesn't matter,
Anything to get what you want

How much can you get now?
What's the cost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted,
Everything you wanted?

How much is enough now?
What was lost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted?
Everything you want, I want it more

I want it more

Our destiny connected,
Invited, unexpected,
Life isn't fair, but still it goes on (goes on)

We all live and we all die,
Say hello then say goodbye,
The sun will set until the next dawn (next dawn)

Inch by inch over old bones,
Shaking hands with the dead souls,
You make your deal and the weight grows,
Anything to get what you want

How much can you get now?
What's the cost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted,
Everything you wanted?

How much is enough now?
What was lost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted?
Everything you want, I want it more

Rung by rung on the ladder (ladder),
Don't slow down, only faster,
Knock yourself out; doesn't matter,
Anything to get what you want

How much can you get now?
What's the cost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted,
Everything you wanted?

How much is enough now?
What was lost?
Tell me, was it everything you wanted?
Everything you want, I want it more

Another day, another full seizure,
Another pill, you spiral down deeper,
Another cut by a surgical butcher,
It's just a way of prolonging the torture

I won't say I don't know what I'm doing,
I won't say that I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

I can't bring you back,
I can't leave you helpless (helpless),
I'll make the pain rest in peace (rest in peace)

I'll turn off the lights,
Swallow your last breath (last breath),
So close your eyes, fall asleep (close your eyes)

I'll never hurt you (hurt you),
I'll never hurt you (hurt you)

The sun shines on this deadly new morning,
The church bells ring an early warning,
Your eyes shine as I turn on the motor,
The tears fall as the mercy gets closer

I won't say I don't know what I'm doing,
I won't say that I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

I can't bring you back,
I can't leave you helpless (helpless),
I'll make the pain rest in peace (rest in peace)

I'll turn off the lights,
Swallow your last breath (last breath),
So close your eyes, fall asleep (close your eyes)

I'll never hurt you (hurt you),
I'll never hurt you (hurt you)

I can't bring you back,
I can't leave you helpless (helpless),
I'll make the pain rest in peace (rest in peace)

I'll turn off the lights,
Swallow your last breath (last breath),
So close your eyes, fall asleep (close your eyes)

I'll never hurt you (hurt you),
I'll never hurt you (hurt you)

We all must stand together now
A one by one we fall
For all these years you stood by me
God bless
I love you all

A Monday morning earthquake
Another weak tooth, backache
Keep him alive for god's sake
Higher, liar when the will is the vice

I broke a mirror in his dolls house
An all night soldier of love
He swallowed down another fantasy pill
To give himself a push and a shove.

Tonight's the night he's gonna jump the moon
I hope he'll never crash and burn too soon.
He's just lit another live wire
It's just the bread we borrow
Here today like it'll be gone tomorrow

Another daylight foreigner
He's just a weekend warrior
Come on he plays life anymore
Love for pound and turned around

He only listens to the voice in his head
Than separate the truth from the lies
A wounded creature that just won't slow down
You can tell by the look in his eyes

Oh
He's flying high with his silver spoon
Oh
He's really gonna try and jump for jump yeah
Jump the moon

Oh
Tonight's the night he's gonna jump the moon
He's just lit another live wire
It's just the bread we borrow
Here today like it'll be gone tomorrow.
