I feel like I've been locked up tight
for a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're licking your lips
And blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby. Baby. baby Baby ,baby, baby

Ooh my body is saying let's go
Ooh but my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
You Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's fading
The lights down low
Just one more dance
And then were gonna go
Waiting for someone
Who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby

Ooh my body is saying let's go
Ooh but my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle I'm a genie in a bottle

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free...
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe

Like a rock, you waited so patiently, while I got it together
While I figured it out I only looked, but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holding hands, making plans
And lucky for me, you understand

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free...
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me

A weaker man might have walked away
But you had faith strong enough to move
Over and understand while I got it together
While I figured it out
They say, "If you love something, let it go
If it comes back, it's yours; that's how you know."
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willing to give me more

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me

Somebody sensitive and tough
Somebody there when the going gets rough
Every night he'll be giving his love
To just one girl, one girl, one
Somebody cool but real tender too
Somebody, baby, just like you
Can keep me hanging around with
The one who always knew
And I'm thanking you
For being there for me

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free...
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me

And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly...
And I'm thanking you for being there for me...

When I'm lost
In the rain In your eyes
I know I'll find
the light to light my way

When I'm scared, losing ground
When my world
is goin crazy
You can turn it all around

And when I'm down
You're there pushin me to the top
You're always there
givin me all you've got

For a shield from the storm
For a friend for a love
to keep me safe and warm
I Turn To You
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For every thing you do
for everything that's true
I Turn to You

When I lose the will to win
I just reach for you
and I can reach the sky again
I can do anything
cause your love is so amazing
Cause your love inspires me
And when I need a friend
You're always on my side
Giving me faith
Taking me through the night

For the arms to be my shelter
through all the rain
For a truth that will never change
For someone to lean on
For a heart I can
rely on through anything
For a the one
who I can run to
I turn to you
To keep me safe and warm
I turn to you

For the strength
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
for everything thats true
I Turn To You

It's either black or white, that's right
We're makin love or in a fight
Sometimes you make me so blue

But then it feels so good, I knew it would
You know the way to make me crazy
I want to give it to you

You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional

You take me high and low, you know
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go
You're such a mystery to me

But baby hot or cold, you got a hold
Of my imagination
I think you know what i mean

You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional

Rain is falling down on me
Suddenly the sun comes out
Sometimes north or south of love
But never out.

C’mon over, c'mon over, baby.

Hey, boy, don't you know

Look at me
You may think you see
Who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day
It's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

I am now
In a world where I
Have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world
What's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection
Someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

There's a heart that must be
Free to fly
That burns with a need to know
The reason why

Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?
I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

Hey there boy did ya happen to know
Wherever you go I'll follow
Ooh babe you're like a cool breeze
On a summer day
When you're near me
I don't know what to do
I feel like a fool
Like a school girl
True blue girl
Who wants to know
Can you come out and play

You make me feel the way
A woman is supposed to feel
Let me show you
Show you that my love's for real

I'll be the rain in your summer
The chill in your fall
I'll be watcha want
Anything at all
I've got a love for all seasons
A love for all time

The sun in your spring
I'll do what you want
Give ya everything
I've got a love for all seasons
A love for all time

I'll be there for you
Keepin you warm
Through the storm
I'll guide you
Stand by you until the stars
Fall from the sky
When you call me

Makin you wait for my love
Never lie love
It's something that I just can't deny
I'll read your each and every feelin
When you need me to
So now I gotta let you know
This love's for you

You don't have to search no more
Baby you don't have to dream
Cause what I've got inside for you
It's all that you'll ever need

Hand in hand they pass me by
Wish I was one of them
Wish I had somebody
Wakin' up beside me
Looking into my eyes at night
I want a love to call my own
I want someone that I can hold
Want someone wanting me
Wanna feel how it feels to be

Somebody's somebody
Someone's someone
Some sweet lover's lover
I wanna be that one
Someone faithful to someone faithful
Someone kind to someone kind to me
Somebody to somebody who loves me
Who loves me

Spending all of my time
Spending all my time on me
Where is that someone who
I can give my time to
Searching for that lover
With the love that will change my life
I want two arms to hold me close
I want the thing I need the most
Somebody needing me
So I can feel how it feels to be

What I'm looking for
Is someone to love me more
Than I've been loved before
With love so right
What I need to find
Is someone to hold me tight
What I mean is i want to be

Somebody's somebody
Somebody's somebody
Somebody's somebody
Somebody's somebody
I wish I was
Somebody's baby

When you put your hands on me..
When you put your hands on me..

I don't know about the travel of time
And I've never seen most of the world
I don't know
Diving out of the sky
Or living like the diamonds
of pearls

See I haven't danced to a musical tune
And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom
I haven't smiled
When alone in my room very much
Then we touched

I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel sexy
And my body turns to gold
I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel ready
And I lose my self-control

When you put your hands on me..

I don't know if a doll can unwind
Or how to make a person go
I don't know how to be what you like
And simply open up the depth of my soul

So I keep my wings
And my eyes on the down
Ready for nothing
But holding my ground
I haven't used
A particular noun very much
Then we touched

When you put your hands on me..
When you put your hands on me..

I won't notice
Or pay you no mind
Boy I couldn't care less
What you do with your time
Your fingertips on my hips
Just move me like one of a kind

When you put your hands on me
I feel so sexy
And my body turns to gold
I just know
When you put your hands on me
I feel ready
And I lose my self-control

When I think, how life used to be;
Always walking in the shadows.
Then I look, at what you've given me;
I feel like dancing on my tip-toes.

I must say everyday I pray
When realize you're by my side
I know I'm truly...

Blessed for everything you've given me;
Blessed for all the tenderness you show;
Do my best with every breath that's in me;
Blessed to make sure you never go.

There are times, that I test your
faith, 'til you think you might surrender.
Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say, that my
hopes will grow in splendor

You walked by in the nick of time
looking like an answered prayer
You know I'm truly...

Blessed for everything you've given me;
Blessed for all the tenderness you show;
Do my best with every breath that's in me;
Blessed to make sure you never go.

Blessed with love and understanding;
Blessed when I hear you call my name;
Do my best with faith that's never-ending;
Blessed to make sure you feel the same.

Deep inside you fill me with your tender touch...
You know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me;
Blessed for all the tenderness you show;
Do my best with every breath that's in me;
Blessed to make sure you never go.

No one ever said that
Love was gonna be easy
Gotta take the ups and downs
The in-betweens
If you take this journey
Gotta give yourself completely
Never let nobody ever step on a dream

You better stop
Listen to these words I say
You better stop
Don't you throw this good thing away
no no
Put your trust in me
And I'll make you see

No the rain wont last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
Love will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say good-bye to tears and sorrow
Better listen when I say
Love will find a way

Somebody tried to tell me love
don't last forever
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams
After all is said and done
We're still here together
Never listen to the lies and jealousy

You better stop
Don't you let them turn you around
You better stop
Hang onto this love that we've found
Nothing that they say
Can stand in our way

I want you
I need you
You know that I
Believe you
We got it
You know it
So if it's real
Just show it baby

I want you
I need you
You know that I
Believe you
We got it
You know it
So if it's real
Just show it baby

Try
Listen to these words
That I say
Try
Don't you throw
This good thing away
No
Put your trust in me
And I'll make you see

I want you
I need you
You know that I
Believe you
We got it
You know it
So if it's real
Just show it

I want you
I need you
You know that I
Believe you
We got it
You know it
So if it's real
Just show it

Can you hear it in my voice
Was it something I let slip
Does the whole world know
Isn't it obvious?

I'm the one who's in control
Now i'm acting like a fool
Do my feelings show?
Is my face aglow?
Isn't it obvious?

That I don't know what
I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Do you see my hands, they tremble
Wonder why I can't
Look you in the eyes
Don't know how long
I can keep this inside
Isn't it obvious?

That I don't know what
I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Suddenly these emotions are
In control of my heart
Can you see it in my eyes
Every glance, every smile
Must give me away
And I feel so much I can't hide

That I don't know what
I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

I dream, there's nothing that's too tough
There's nothing that's hard enough
For me and you, to get through
And I know, that with your hand in mine
There's not a goal, we can't reach in time
Life can bring us down, you see
Sometimes it's been our destiny
But I foresee, possibilities
For you and me, ohh
I can hold the faith, I know
That will see us through, it all
I have had a dream

You and I can
Get through anything

Get passed everything, ohh no
I feel, all can become real
Nothing's too impossible
For us to do, ohh and
I see, endless opportunities
We can reach oh, if we both believe, ohh
Sometimes hoping's not enough
The paths ahead can be so tough
But if we stay, confident we'll see
A brighter day, ohh
I can hold the faith, I know
That will see us through, the end
Ohh ooh, oh yeah yeah
I have had a dream

You and I can
Get through anything

Mmmm
Yeah, oh yeah, oh oh
Oh yeah
I was alone just because
I wasn't like them
They made me, excluded so cruel, and
Then there was you
You stood by me, ignored their words
You became, my best friend so true, oh yeah
You believed in me
When no one else did
You gave me the strength to
Move on, my friend
You will always be
The one I remember
To give my thanks to
For my success
They just did not understand
What I was going through
My situation, they didn't care, no
You tried to take a stand for me
When I just could not
Take it any longer
You believed in me
When no one else did
You gave me the strength to
Move on, my friend
You will always be
The one I remember
To give my thanks to
For my success
I ohh, as I look back
I can see how childish they were
And you ohh, you showed me that
We were so much more than they were
I hope they can see their mistakes now
And not do it to another
But if they don't, I hope that person
Finds someone like you
Ohh...
You believed in me
When no one else did
Yeah ohh, no, ohh yeah, oh
You will always be
The one I remember
Will always be the one I remember, oh no
For my success

I've waited a long time for this
It feels right now
Allow me to introduce myself
I want you to come a little closer
I'd like you to get to know me a little bit better
Meet the real me

Sorry you can't define me
Sorry I break the mold
Sorry that I speak my mind
Sorry don't do what I'm told
Sorry if I don't fake it
Sorry I come too real
I will never hide what I really feel

Huh, so here it is
No hype, no gloss, no pretense
Just me
Stripped

So what am I not supposed to have an opinion
Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman
Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy will do
Making up a few false rumors or two

That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy 
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Shout louder!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will

So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended by the message I'm bringing
Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore

I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
What do we do girls?
Shout louder!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Check it - Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can either give us some head, sex her off
If the girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the table's about to turn
I'll bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it
It's aiight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

But you're just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big 
To make up for small lil' things
So you're just a little boy
All you'll do is annoy
You must talk so big 
To make up for small lil' things

This is for my girls...
This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Shout louder!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Shout louder!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down
Spread the word, can't hold us down


I was naive, your love was like candy 
Artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping, 
Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed 
I was prey in your bed and devoured completely

And it hurts my soul 
Cause I can't let go 
All these walls are caving' in 
I can't stop my sufferin' 
I hate to show I've lost control 
cause I keep goin' right back to the one thing 
That I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya , 
to walk away from ya 
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known that I was used for amusement 
Couldn't see through the smoke, 
it was all an illusion 
Now I've been lickin' my wounds 
But the venom seeps deeper 
We both can seduce 
But darlin' you hold me prisoner

Oh I'm about to break 
I can't stop this ache 
I'm addicted to your allure, 
and I'm fiendin' for a cure 
Every step I take leads to one mistake, 
I keep goin' right back to the one thing 
That I need to walk away from 
I'm about to break and can't stop this ache, 
getting nothing in return 
What did I do to deserve 
The pain of this slow burn 
And everywhere I turn 
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need 
To walk away from

I need to get away from ya, 
Need to walk away from ya, 
Get away, walk away, walk away

Every time I try to grasp for air, 
I am smothered in despair 
It's never over, over 
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare 
I let out a silent prayer 
Let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming 
Begging, pleading no more

Now what to do my heart has been bruised, 
So sad but it's true 
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul cause I can't let go 
All these walls are cavin' in 
I can't stop my sufferin' 
I hate to show that I lost control 
Cause I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need, oh 
I'm about to break 
and I can't stop this ache 
I'm addicted to your allure 
And I'm fiending for a cure 
Every step I take leads to one mistake, 
I keep going right back to the one thing that I need, oh 
I can't mend, this torn state I'm in 
Getting nothing in return, what did I do to deserve 
The pain of this slow burn 
And everywhere I turn 
I keep going right back to the one thing that I need 
To walk away from

Well I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust
Called your bluff 
time is up
cause I've had enough

You were there by my side
always down for the ride
but your joyride
just came down in flames
cause your deeds
sold me out in shame

After all of the stealing, your cheating
you probably think
that I hold resentment for you
but...you're wrong

Cause if it wasn't for all that 
you tried to do
I wouldn't know 
just how capable
I am to pull through

so I wanna say thank you

Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Never saw it coming
all of your backstabbing
just so you could
cash in on my good thing
before I realized your game

I heard your going round
playing the victim now
but don't even begin
feeling I'm the one to blame
cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
guess you wanted to harm me
but that won't work any more
no more...it's over

Cause if it wasn't for
all of your torture
I wouldn't know how
to be this way now and 
never back down

so I wanna say thank you

Ooh oh, hey
Hey...ooh ohh, hey

He comes from a foreign place
An island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless
Can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss

Mama used to warn me
To beware of those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother
I said ay mama, you seem to forget
I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realized
Big brown eyes can hypnotize
When he says

I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
It's pure infatuation
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Hey...

Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within
Feels so good it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started
I'm giving in
He brings life to my fantasies
Sparks a passion inside of me
Finds the words when I can not speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me

Mama used to warn me
Not to rush love with another
She said I'm not trying to lecture
I just care about my daughter
Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let
A man control my emotions
But when he smiles when he smiles
I feel like a little child
When he says

I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm whoa, whoa
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
It's pure infatuation
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah

Caught between my mama's words
And what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world
But a part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it, can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico
I can't hold back no more
Let's go tonight...
Ooh, hey

You adore me, never be lonely, ohh

I am full blood boricua boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm on his arm
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero oh, quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation

I can't help, what I'm feeling
Infatuated
Oh ooh, ohh...
Infatuation
Hey

Ooo you make me want to fly
Crying sky on that mountain
I'm so so afraid
Afraid of love's embrace

People ask if I'm in love with you
Because I'm sitting here with your picture 
And smiling to myself
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through 
And I blush as I say yes

What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me 
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being 
With abilities to set me free
Free, make me be me
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality thats hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me
Is that you're loving me for me

People ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by saying
You got my heart by just being who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter about the money I make 
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star

Unconditionally you're there for me 
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet
This is meaningful, is incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
The way I feel, so sweet
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality thats hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me
Is that you're loving me for me

Its so amazing how something so sweet 
Has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny
Oh, heaven came and saved me 
An angel was placed at my feet
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me

Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups
With him, I dont have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in
He's real,he's honest, he's loving me for me
Yeah

Play something for me Alicia...
I just got something on my mind

Speak on it girl

It's impossible
It's impossible to love you
If you don't let me know what you're feeling
It's impossible for me to give you what you need
If you're always hidin' from me

I don't know what hurt you
I just, I wanna make it right
Cos boy I'm sick and tired of trying to read your mind

It's impossible impossible
Oh baby it's impossible for me to love you
It's the way it is
It's impossible impossible
Oh baby it's impossible
If you makin' it this way

Impossible to make it easy
If you always tryin' to make it so damn hard
How can I, how can I give you all my love, baby
If you're always, always puttin' up your guard

This is not a circus
Don't you play me for a clown
How long can emotions keep on goin' up and down

It's impossible impossible
Oh baby it's impossible for me to love you
It's the way it is
It's impossible impossible
Oh baby it's impossible
If you keep treating me this way
Over, over over and over

Impossible baby impossible, impossible
If you makin' it this way, this way
Oh baby, it's impossible
If you makin' it this way

I remember when it all first began
We were tight right from the start
It wasn't long before you came on strong
Trying hard to win my heart trying to win it

I played hard to get but I couldn't help
I gave up my ironing
You were thoughtful
Careful not to hurt the relationship

What happened to those days when
You used to be compassionate
Caring what I thought and said
So attentive gentleman
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set
Taking me for granted lately
Frankly, it's gotta quit

I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out 
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say
I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

Back to the beginning, to the very beginning
When our love was something new
Back when romance was important
Not just another thing to do

I was feeling high on love tonight
Thought I never come back down
Now it seems that you and me
Have lost our solid ground

Half the time I realise
I seem to give more than I get
Funny how things seem to change
After a few years commitment

Used to talk for hours on end
'Bout our dreams while we lay in bed
How I missed those days when you stayed awake
Now you roll over and snore instead

I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out 
'Cause you know what I'm talking about, I say
I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I miss those nice massages
The long for closeness
The way you talk
How it turned me on
The thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips

I needed those days back

I feel underappreciated
Now girls help me out 
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say
I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure
From all the fame, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone and the puzzle undone
That's the way it is

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words won't bring you down
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words won't bring you down
Don't you bring me down today...

No matter what we do 
no matter what we do
No matter what they say 
no matter what they say
When the sun is shining through
Then the clouds won't stay

And everywhere we go 
everywhere we go
The sun won't always shine 
sun won't always shine
But tomorrow will find a way 
All the other times

We are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down
We are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words can't bring us down
Don't you bring me down today

Don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down today

I can't believe what you did to me
Down on my knees and I need to break free
All these years, you violated me

I don't know why I can't feel inside
Trying to hide, can't make it all right
It's overkill, now I'm ready to fight ready to fight

I don't need nobody trying to make me over make me over 
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day

Feeling confined, like I'm being forced in
My vision's blurry and I'm lost in regrets
It's overload, and I'm out of control out of control

So sick and tired of feeling so misused feeling so misused
Taking me down with all your mental abuse
I must say, gotta get you out of my head

Everybody's always trying to look me over look me over
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me

Leaving the house another quarter to five
Slipped on my boots and I'm ready to ride
And I feel so high, I feel so alive

Let down my hair, feel the wind on my skin wind on my skin
Crossing the water where my new life begins
And I close my eyes and take it all in

I don't need nobody trying to make me over make me over 
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me

I just wanna get away
Save it, all your bullshit, for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me

You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down

I'm leaving today
Living it, leaving it to change

Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
Tongue tied, twisted are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags finally on the move

I'm leaving today
I'm living it, leaving it to change

As I'm driving I'm captured by the view
Of so much beauty, the road becomes my muse
The heat is rising and my head soars through the wind
Cool, calm, collective is a child that lost a thing

I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
But somehow I'm missing
I think I really miss it

Don't walk away 
And I'm feeling like I've never felt before
Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams
I'm free, finally free

Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze

I'm leaving today
I'm living it, leaving it to change
See I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
I'm leaving today I'm leaving it to change
Living it, I'm leaving it to change

Living it, leaving it
Said I'm living it, leaving it
Living it, leaving it to change 
I'm leaving it to change
But somehow I miss it
I think I really miss it 
One day

When they push, when they pull
Tell me can you hold on
When they say you should change
Can you lift your head high and stay strong

Will you give up, give in
When your heart's crying out "that is wrong"
Will you love you for you at the end of it all

Now in life there's gonna be times 
When you're feeling low
And in your mind insecurities seem to take control
We start to look outside ourselves 
For acceptance and approval
We keep forgetting that the one thing we should know is

Don't be scared
To fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door

See in your hands the world is yours
Don't hold back and always know 
All the answers you will unfold
What are you waiting for 
Spread your wings and soar

The boy who wonders, is he good enough for them
Keep trying to please them all
But he just never seems to fit in
Then there's the girl who thinks she'll never ever be
Good enough for him
He's trying to change and
That's a game she'll never win

In life there will be times when you're feeling low
And in your mind insecurities seem to take control
We start to look outside ourselves 
For acceptance and approval
We keep forgetting that one thing we should know is

Don't be scared
To fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door

See in your hands the world is yours
Don't hold back and always know 
All the answers they will unfold
What are you waiting for 
Spread your wings and soar

In the mirror is where she comes 
Face to face with her fears
Her reflection looked forward on to her 
After all these years
However how she's tried to be 
Something besides herself
Now time has passed and she's ended up 
Somewhere else with regret

What is it is that makes us feel the need
To keep pretending 
Gotta let ourselves be

Don't be scared
To fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door

See in your hands the world is yours
Don't hold back and always know 
All the answers you will unfold
Don't wait no more
Spread your wings and soar

Find your road
Love will open every door
See in your hands the world is yours
Don't look back in the window, you'll find your way
Always know all the answers will unfold

Oh don't wait
Spread your wings and soar
Don't wait no more
You've got to soar
Spread your wings and soar
Don't wait no more
No don't you wait no more
Spread your wings and soar
You've can soar

So what you waiting for
Don't wait, Don't wait
Soar

Baby you pretend that things ain't what they seem
All this tension telling me just exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us being some kind of casual thing
Listen, all I wanna do right now is have your contact on me

Can you put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

If you see me with a man
Understand that you can't question me
The feelings that you call, it ain't my fault
It can't help your jealousy
If you can handle the fact that 
What we have has got to be commitment free
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin', hittin'
Underneath the sheets

Can you put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

Now listen
So, come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty
All night a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'
Cause this is a physical lovin'
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5

We have a physical thing
We'll make love, but don't fall in love
Let me get mine, you get yours
You spend time
Just enough so you get yours, and I get mine
No strings attached
I want your body, not your heart
Let me get mine, you get yours

Can you put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

Put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

Come here
Don't be shy
I won't bite
Let me get mine, you get yours

Sorry if I ain't perfect
Sorry I don't give a 
Sorry I ain't a diva
Sorry just know what I want
Sorry I'm not a virgin
Sorry I'm not a slut
I won't let you break me
Think what you want

To all my dreamers out there - I'm with you
All my underdogs, ha - I feel you
Lift your head high and stay strong
Keep pushin' on

Young girl, don't cry
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall
Young girl, it's all right
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly

When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream 
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems
No one ever wants or bothers to explain
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means

When there's no one else
Look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend
Just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength
That will guide your way
If you will learn to begin 
To trust the voice within

Young girl, don't hide
You'll never change if you just run away
Young girl, just hold tight
And soon you're gonna see your brighter day

Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
When you're lost outside look inside to your soul

When there's no one else
Look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend
Just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength
That will guide your way
If you will learn to begin 
To trust the voice within

Yeah...
Life is a journey 
It can take you anywhere you choose to go
As long as you're learning
You'll find all you'll ever need to know

You'll make it
You'll make it
Just don't go forsaking yourself
No one can stop you
You know that I'm talking to you

When there's no one else
Look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend
Just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength
That will guide your way
If you will learn to begin 
To trust the voice within

Young girl don't cry
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall

Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Everytime my father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday
And I'm OK

I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echo of a broken child screaming "please no more"
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday

It's not so easy to forget
All the lines you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And every day I'm afraid to come home
In fear of what I might see there

Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday
And I'm OK
I'm OK

hhh, Yeah, Oooh Huh
I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
& Nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothings been going my way lately
So I decided right here and now that my outlooks gotta change

That's why I'm gonna
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried
For everytime somebody hurt my pride
Feeling like they won't let me live life
& Take the time to look at what is mine

I see every lesson completely
I thank God for what I got from above
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they wanna say about me

But I'm gonna carry on
Keep on singing my song

I never wanna dwell on my pain again
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then
Remembering all of the hell I felt when I was running out of faith
Every step I vowed to take was towards a better day

Cos I'm about to
Say goodbye to every single lie
& All the fears I've held too long inside
Everytime I felt I could try
All the negativity I had inside

For too long I've been struggling. I couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feeling strong and moving on
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they wanna say about me

But I'm gonna carry on
I'm gonna keep on singing my song

Whoa, & everytime I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally
So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see
All the good around me
They wasted so much energy on what they thought of me
Simply just remembering to breathe

I'm human, I ain't able to please
Everyone at the same time, so now I find
My peace of mind living one day at a time

I'm human and I answer to one god
It comes down to one love
Until I get to heave above

I've made the decision 
Never to give up
Till the I day I die no matter what

I'm gonna carry on & keep on singing my song.....

They can't take anything from me

I believe that they can do what they wanna. 
Say what they wanna say

They can say what they wanna

But I'm gonna keep on 
Keep on 
I believe it
That they can take from me
But they can't take my inner peace

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Say what you wanna say, but I'm gonna sing my song
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
