You, you say, you have lost the way
Got no aim, just livin' for today
Look up to the sky above
And see the morning sun again
You got so much power inside
So cry it out my friend

I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive

There's no use in hangin' all around
You're a king, can't you see your crown
Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
you just need a friend
Together we will sing along

Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
You just need a friend
Together we will sing along

Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground

Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I wanna do so much in my way"
Higher
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burning so hot in my head

Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I wanna do so much in my way"

We got
A little time to build up our lives
A little time to make up our minds
A little time to fill up our dreams
A little time, time

We'we thrown away our former gods
Controlling our day
We have created better ones
So we control the way

We are the ones with the power
To hold down the enemy
Our gods are perfection
And they are protecting our lives
We still need some more of them
To be safe from the other side
As long as we're stronger
Nothing will happen to us

Fireflash in the night
Just an evil dream
Holy war in the sky... never

Error in store 103
We watch the sun at night
The pretty gods we're built ourselves
Now terminate our lives
Silicone brain powered voices
Are crying "attack" tonight
Our gods are now fighting
In anger, burning our world
Doomsday has come
And there is no place to hide away
The future is over
And there is no turning back
Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky.....

Twilight of the gods
Insania's dead and gone
Another world was born
But the twilight soon will come
Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky.....

Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid it's breakin' twice

Thank to you, my dear old friend
But you can't help, this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I won't have no sleep tonight

In my heart, in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong, young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain

It's alright, we'll stay friends
Trustin' in my confidence
And let's say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight

With my heart, with my soul
Some guys cry you bought and sold
They've been strong, young and bold
And they say, play this song again

If you're out there all alone
And you don't know where to go to
Come and take a trip with me to Future World

And if you're running through your life
And you don't know what the sense is
Come and look how it could be, in Future World

We all live in happiness our life is full of joy
We say the world "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side
We love our life and we know we will stay

'Cause we all live in Future World
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious
Come with me - Future World

You say you'd like to stay,
But this is not your time
Go back, find your own way to Future World

Life can be for living
Just try and never give in
Tell everyone the way of Future World

One day you'll live in happiness
With a heart that's full of joy
You'll say the world "tomorrow" without fear

The feeling of togerherness will be at your side
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why

Masquerade, masquerade,
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out well disguised
Heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store,
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat they have no choice,
Little ghost's are makin' lotsa noise

But watch out... beware - listen... take care

In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise
Ah - It's Halloween
Ah - It's Halloween... tonight!

Someone's sitting in a field,
Never giving yield
Sittin' there with gleamin' eyes,
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone,
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie

But watch out... beware - listen... take care

Listen now - we are calling you...
And there is magic in the air

Magic in the air... on Halloween
Black is the night full of fright
You'll be missing the day
What will be here very soon
Changing your way
A knock at your door
It is real or is it a dream
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream... on Halloween

Darkness
Where am I now
Is there anybody out there
What has happened
Am I in heaven
Or is it hell

I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining
It's shining so bright
It's shining on me

I am the one, doom's in my hands
Now make your choice,
Redeemed or enslaved

I'll show you passion and glory
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man

Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind's
Deliverance and peace of mind

But watch out... beware - listen... take care

Yeah, it's Halloween

Yeah, it's Halloween... tonight!

Now that you've made your choice
Follow the sign

Did you make your choice?
You're the Keeper of the seven key
Our only hope's your victory
So follow the sign

People are in big confusion
they don't like their constitutions
everyday they draw conclusions
and they're still prepared for war

Some can say what's ineffective
some make up themselves attractive
build up things they call protective
well your life seems quite bizarre

In the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on its wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday

Hey, we think so supersonic
and we make our bombs atomic
or the better quite neutronic
but the poor don't see a dime

Nowadays the air's polluted
ancient people persecuted
that's what mankind contributed
to create a better time

In the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on its wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday

When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
when I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back

There's just one way I see
the way I think it's right for me
you say to me I will repent what I do
if it's right I'll stop before

When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
it's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
and I reveal what I have loved before

There's just one way I see
the way I think it's right for me
you say to me I will repent what I do
if it's right I'll stop before

The life I try to give is
all I have inside of me
it's one kind of life for me
this music you hear
the strength we have inside is
so much more than you will know
but if you can't see the life around
you'll always walk alone

Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
see his strong hands
but tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
see the drunk man, try to ask him why
he will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
there's a fight in his head he cannot win
getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin

You--you cannot hide
You--you cannot describe your feelings inside

The life I try to give is
all I have inside of me
it's one kind of life for me
this music you hear
the strength we have inside is
so much more than you will know
but if you can't see the life around
you'll always walk alone

Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
everyone could see him fall
and be sure it's been his last hit
he's never been seen at all

Some dictator felt progressive
and lay down in the sun
but his people were aggressive
they killed him with a gun

Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie

It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain

A little dragon could spit fire
but never so for something bad
he didn't know the knight's desire
to throw a lance into his head

Romeo loved his Juliet
their parents told them "Stop"
then it all turned out peculiar
he couldn't get it up

And it's all in vain
when you're living with pain
reap not goods you have grown
by your own
feelings you like
disappear overnight
you sip up every grin
free to win

It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
you nearly go insane

A spaceman flies the rocket
that takes him to the stars
thinks his wife is in his pocket
but she's strolling 'round in bars

The king of Los Angeles
bought himself a teddy bear
and the queen became shameless
she did it with a chair

Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie

It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain

Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
now he's making better ones on a higher step

On a warm summer day the doctor went away
to a place where he could make it real
his assistant's hips were nice
so he cloned her once or twice
now his hips are aching what a deal

Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
lets them run into the night
they become
great rock musicians
great politicians
a great possession
a great oppression

Sometimes when he's feeling bored
he's calling it a day
he's got his computers and they do it their own way

They mix some DNA, some skina and a certain spray
you can watch it on a laser screen
and the fellow's blue and grey
or sometimes pink and green
just check it out on Halloween

Dr. Stein grows funny creatures. . .

One night he cloned himself
put his brother on a shelf
but when he fell asleep that night
it crept up from behind and thought "well never mind"
took a syringe and blew out his life

Don't turn your head
back to the wall
don't close your eyes
and wait for your fall

If you believe that you know in this time
you've got anything to win
if you believe that you know
then I say, "you'll lose all again"

In this time there's nothing to get for you
you cannot really do what you want
you're a child, a prisoner in your mind
you are a victim of this hopeless time

You better believe all you do has a sense
it's not for nothing
you better believe all the troubles you have
will play you someday

Why don't you help yourself and do the best
put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
why don't you stand up to say who you are
to show the people that paradise is not far

Oh, can't you see we got the right
to look into the future without no need to hide
no, we won't accept what you do
we stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can

We are credulous idiots
and won't understand what they plan
we march with the times
it's what they expect and we do

Why don't you open your eyes
to undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
go oppose with your fist
fight for your rights

Oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can

Too late to call for the priest
he is not here anymore
we look at the age of the beast
and we've seen its vast armies form
hear our call

Please, save us
please, save us

In permanent madness we live
no time for life and for love
to take is the rule, not to give
insanity comes from below
to take us all

Please, save us
please, save us

We believe that the phenomena of nature
are the expression of infinitive intelligence
we express our belief that all forms of life
are manifestations of spirit
and thus, all men are children of God

Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
waiting for his future and the final call

We stand on the edge of the world
just one step more and we fall
guide us and please take our hands
without you we're weak and alone
hear our call

Please, save us
please, save us

Now!

Save us--from the gods of thunder
Save us--from the dogs of war
Save us--from the creeping nightmares
Save us--from the evil's course
Save us--from our own ignorance
Save us--from the man in black
Save us--from the desolation
Save us--from the hate attack
Save us--oh please
Save us--please save us
Save us--oh please
Save us--now!

Hours of lust, hours of tears passing by before my eyes
today, tomorrow, yesterday. . .one life
days of joy, day of sadness come and go to pass me by
a month, a year, one hundred years, they fly

Ohh, one day I will be gone to lead another life
ohh, and this world will stop to turn around with me
'cause

Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally

Times of peace, times of fights, constant movement is our life
can't stop no more, not until. . .we die
we long for more. . .eternity, and maybe there's another life
this one is short, no matter how you try

Ohh, but never give up all the hope to lead a good life
no, don't waste your given time to make things worse

Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
one without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally

Please, please help me see, the best way to be
make a change and we, live eternally
no more wasted years, no more wasted tears
life's too short to cry, long enough to try

Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally

From our lives' beginning on
we are pushed in little forms
no one asks us how we like to be
in school they teach you what to think
but everyone says different things
but they're all convinced that
they're the ones to see

So they keep talking and they never stop
and at a certain point you give it up
so the only thing that's left to think is this

I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free

People tell me A and B
they tell me how I have to see
things that I have seen already clear
so they push me then from side to side
they're pushing me from black to white
they're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
shut your mouth and take it home
'cause I decide the way things gonna be

I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free

There's a million ways to see the things in life
a million ways to be the fool
in the end of it, none of us is right
sometimes we need to be alone

No no no, leave me alone

I want out--to live my life alone
I want out--leave me be
I want out--to do things on my own
I want out--to live my life and to be free

Make the people
hold each other's hands
and fill their hearts with truth
you made up your mind
so do as divined

Put on your armour
ragged after fights
hold up your sword
you're leaving the light
make yourself ready
for the lords of the dark
they'll watch your way
so be cautious, quiet and hark

You hear them whispering
in the crowns of the trees
you're whirling 'round
but your eyes don't agree
will 'o' the wisps
misguiding your path
you can't throw a curse
without takin' their wrath

Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
or all us people forget what we've been
our only hope's your victory
kill that Satan who won't let us be--kill!

You're the keeper of the seven keys
that lock up the seven seas
and the seer of visions said before he went blind
hide them from demons and rescue mankind
or the world we're all in will soon be sold
to the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

You can feel cold sweat
running down your neck
and the dwarfs of falseness
throw mud at your back

Guided by spells
from the old seer's hand
you're suffering pain
only steel can stand

Stay well on your way and follow the sign
fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
the seven seas are far away
placed in the valley of dust heat and sway

You're the keeper of the seven keys
that lock up the seven seas
and the seer of visions said before he went blind
hide them from demons and rescue mankind
or the world we're all in will soon be sold
to the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

Throw the first key into the sea of hate
throw the second key into the sea of fear
throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
and make the people hold each other's hands
the fourth key belongs into the sea of greed
and the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease my friend
for this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease my friend
throw the key or you may die

On a mound at the shore of the last sea
he is sitting, fixing your sight
with his high iron voice causing sickness
he is playing you out with delight
man who do you just think you are?
a silly bum with seven stars
don't throw the key or you will see
dimensions cruel as they can be
don't let him suck off your power
throw the key. . .!

An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!

You're the keeper of the seven keys
you locked up the seven seas
and the seer of visions can now rest in peace
there ain't no more demons and no more disease
and, mankind, live up, you're free again
yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown
you have given our souls back to light

From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see

You hide, won't fight
Avoid the daylight
Give in, won't win
No try to make it right

Why don't you stop crying
Stop your painful dying
Why don't you give your life a sense

One game, one aim
But you're always sleeping
One light so bright
In darkness you're creeping

Why don't you use your head
Step out of your warm bed
And stop being on anxious rat

Run - for your destination
Fly - to the sun
Don't give a damn what the people may say
It's like a chain on your leg
When you always look back
If you don't risk anything one day you'll pay

Don't run for cover
Don't cry alone
Make a step on your stairway
One step closer to what you live for
Don't run for cover
Don't throw away
The only chance that you got
To be the fire in a hot life you choose

No pride, no right ?
In your heart is more strength
You know, I know
Your destiny's in your hand

Now you have this time
To survive don't be blind
In this world where so many can't see

Try - to catch the key
Make - that you can see
The light of your life your way to go
So many hearts in these times
Are so cold they can't find
Their own power to win they don't know

Will you first time... Will it be... I think of someone like me ?
Makes me wonder,I can show you'd never thought you'd see.
You're like sunshine,I can feel your heat is drying out my brain,
Would you feel like... like we're having fun it I can do the rain ?
Have you thought out your dreams, do you have some ?
Let's see if we can find some more.
Give me your fancies at random,I think we can deal with them all.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me your door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know you're worth the try,
Let me guide you in my spaceship and I'll surely make you have
A R e a l G o o d T i m e .
Don't waste time now - you are soaking wet, so fix the things you got,
Guess you know how - and when you're done I dotta see you strut.
My desire - can I watch you rock and know which one of choose ?
I'm no liar - I could take you down and you got nothing to lose.
I don't know any better occasion, can't hold back, it's the end of the day
I don't think you're here for the first time, no problem with me anyway.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me you door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know we have a try,
I can feel this night is special and I surely make you have
A R e a l G o o d T i m e.

I can't wait forever, baby, open me you door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know we have a try,
I can feel this night is special and I surely make you have
A R e a l G o o d T i m e ......

Now it's time - to shake it all up, to be free,
Now it's time - to make us some room to let us be.
Oh, it feels so bad, yes, if fells so bad,
When everything good looks so bad,
When everything right goes so wrong.
I am up - to break it all down what's in my way,
I won't stop until I am where I'm going to stay.
No one holds me back, no, no one holds me back,
Don't wanna be what I am not,
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck.
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
= Over my head - look over my head =
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
= And you won't see no halo =
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
= It's driving me mad =
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
= I must hold it back inside =
But anyway we've got to make a stop.
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !
In my mind - the battle goes on 'til I give up,
Will we find - the key of life we once have dropped ?
Do you really care ? - Tell me you really care !
You may find Mr. Blane, but the guilt of life burns everywhere.
Give me light to see my inside, give me light to see my sin,
= Over my head - look over my head =
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad,
= And you won't see no halo =
You must be joking when you point at me.
Hey ! Don't you blame me ! Don't you touch me !
Won't you ever leave me be ? I wanna live! Don't wanna think!
= It's driving me mad =
Why should I give what I can drink ?
= I must hold it back inside =
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !
Pain - I feel inside - it's such a Shame.
No one fights fair but who's to Blame ?
Might be the game of life but it ain't over.
Now ! I walk my way firm any
Now ! My conscience speaks and there are Doubts !
But nothing's sure in life and it ain't over. Now !
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
= Over my head - look over my head =
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
= And you won't see no halo =
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.

All I've ever done - I've done for you ! ......

Hey, brother, I miss you so - you knocked on heaven's door,
And we won't see you anymore - it must be crazy what we're living for.
'Cause God's stopped keeping you on the ladder of you life,
I call your name with tears in my eyes.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like a flower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
Life's like a walking on a high wire,
You slipped away, I've seen you dying in vein.
High as mountains seem all the problems that I have,
But when I hear your voice far away out of the dark -
You just go on and on in the back of my mind.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like a flower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
Skin and bone won't touch the sky,
I hope you'll find passage out of the dark.
To the otherside of the sea and I know that I'll see you again.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like a flower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like a flower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.

My little crazy cat took a train to meet his gang downtown.
They played Black Jack< Fritz played his false game too far.
A guy got up and started a gunfight.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
Addicted to chicks, he's got a rental tree near the nudist beach.
Oh, watch out ! Booze and ladies are his fate.
Too much sex and food and Rock'n'Roll.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.

Strong and invincible, they know every rule,
Seems inconceivable anything they do.
They made us their slaves - we weren't unified,
Ever since we paid for selling our lives.
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Deprived of our consciousness, we can't predict what's more,
Can you remember how things used to be before ?
I secretly dream of things we will be taught,
Will someone esteem for those who have fought ?
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Strong and invincible, they know every rule,
Seems inconceivable anything they do.
Deep in our hearts we hope our dreams come true,
The only thing is "What are we to do ?"
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Won't you say it ... Can't you feel it .. ?

Time goes whenever you are, time is your guiding star,
That shines all through your life, makes you feel and move.
My dreams are out in the far, so are yours a part
Of secret fairy tales, dripped on the wings of a mystery mill.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning -
Show me the way, take me today.
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning -
Longing for love and a chance to be free.
Don't feel alone and depressed, someone will come at last,
To soothe your stumbling mind, to keep it away from the evil storm.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning -
Show me the way, take me today.
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning -
Longing for love and a chance to be free.
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning ...
Time goes whenever you are ...

Well,I think it's really time again for a revolution,
Not to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's there.
Can you remember a time when water was still water,
Or are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirs ?
Inhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain !
It'll surely make our children feel a lot more sanel.
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissance,
And today we're all faced with death, rubbers and AIDS.
In'68 some people went out to fight for freedom,
They would never ever have thought that their children wear ties.
And if you come to San Francisco -
You're gonna meet some broken people there.
Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Now !
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...

In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.
I always try to make things better, everything that has gone wrong,
Mighty plans in the right direction but very little has been done.
Everyday when I try to get forward - I find myself another mile back,
Help me fighting, help me breathing - why am I falling down instead ?
Every useful minute seems to be the thought of you,
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do.
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but it's true.
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.
Free from ourselves and free form this world we may find,
The freedom we search ,'cause all that we need is inside.
The hours we waste - we may not get back for a while,
And when it gets dark - no chance will be there for a try.
When I wake up early in the morning I catch a book and jump inside,
I fill my head with a million wonders and try to fill the night with light.
The moment when I get things clearer - I see another mountain to climb.
And always when I think I'm nearer - I realize there is no time.
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
Sometimes I cried after all I lied to you.

When I was a young boy I had no aim,
Neither experience - it wasn't a shame.
Most of the time it satisfied me,
But some day I realized - music is like a rising sun.
Times are now changing and memory fades,
I gaze at the photos, a look in the haze.
You cannot imagine how many friends I've lost,
It's much too late for calling them back.
Music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.
I was always insecure, sometimes I still am,
But I made up my mind now - and look here I stand.
I ask myself sometimes: "Is it all worth it ?"
To fly over mountains - makes you fall down again
But music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.
Music is like sunrise for me,
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine.
Music is like sunrise for me - it's like coming home.

Time has come, start your search for tomorrow,
No escape from that long trail of sorrow.
You don't know how it keeps going on. Oh ... No ...
Wake up out of misty dreams,
Evil drugs is starting to grab you, to grab you.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help ... But can I ?
You did your best to keep yourself down,
Give it a rest and just turn around !
It's only a one way street of lies ... Yes it is !
Living in a twilight zone,
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help you.
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind
To turn you brain inside out, to serve the final rite.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help you !

Give me two strong arms to fight my enemies,
Give me two eyes to see the truth.
Give me two legs I think I have to run,
And fill my heart with faith that I won't lose.
I don't wanna lose ...
Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there,
Make me feel your presence in the night.
Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie,
And take my soul - so I won't have to hide.
I don't wanna hide ...
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do I believe.
I Believe ... I Believe ...
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do ...
There'll be no reason to live without you giving me light,
There is so much that you give, your love is shining so bright.
I Believe ... I Believe ... I Believe ... Believe ...
I wanna love but I always hate - I wanna give but I always take.
Want you to laugh but I make you cry, maybe I won't change 'til I die.
It's so much easier said than done - I know I can't just always run.
Got so much anger inside of me, I understand but I think I see what I'm not.
I know it's true what J.C. said - I got it all clear in my head.
Seens we were born to be unfair,
I am a sinner that's starting to dare ... to Believe.
Give me your hand until the end and I will walk into promised land.
I don't deserve anything you do - but I can't stop loving you.
No more lies, no false religions,
No more "whys" and wrong God missions.
No shiny T.V. priests begging to cash,
No more wars that no God's ever asked for.
There's a way back out of here - one day we're going home,
Tell everyone who wants to hear - whatever you do ... do Believe.
I Believe ... We Believe ... Believe ... Oh !

Feelings come and go - I've never known,
Something longs to grow - won't let go.
Spirits around my head - are whispering,
I turn inside instead - of wondering.
Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me,
How could I see anything - how could I be anything ?
Restless minds have searched - long before,
The truth will be same - for evermore.
The mightiness of trees - that you can feel,
Can give you all you need - just listen still.
Here is love and there is pain.
It's all around, it's all the same,
There's nothing new that I cuold tell to you.
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts,
We might not know the mining yet, but I am sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything - that is and has been and will be.
There is a long way to go - there is a high place to know,
There is a world to go through - but there's so much more to do
Until we're home !
Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me,
How could I see anything - how could I be anything ?
Feelings come and go - I've never known...

I keep wondering all these days
How to thrive the way we stray
A year, a lifetime—parted, together
Will be all the same

Many things do make me sad
Some can even drive me mad
Just fear forever
No more endeavours
Leave me where I stand

You are here
And make me feel so high
Day by day
Something one can't deny
Let's give each other certainty

All over the nations the tunes come alive
Winners and losers, we're all alike
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery
We all fade into one

Don't you feel too hypnotized
Or keep your future jeopardized
So what's accomplished crying for nothing?
Skip depression now

Come, arise and take me higher
No more lies, and every soul can see
We're incarnate sincerity

All over the nations the tunes come alive
Winners and losers, we're all alike
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery
We all fade into one

All over the nations the tunes come alive
Winners and losers, we're all alike
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery
We all fade into one

Black you stripped me
Reveal me the secrets of your pain - painful lies?
Life itself that feeds your wisdom
Almost everyday you put yourself high on a shelf
Whatever you do, wherever you go
Never turn my back on you

Shadows on the wall
Darkness is spreading
I warm my hands on the flames of lies
In vain I scream against the wind
They don't understand my last testament

Escalation 666
Escalation 666
Escalation 666

Deceit and malice
Every smile hides betrayal and greed, hypocrisy
We've been like brothers
Now I hold out my hands to a bloodless, to a bloodless soul

Shadows on the wall
Darkness is spreading
I warm my hands on the flames of lies
In vain I scream against the wind
They don't understand my last testament

Shadows on the wall
Darkness is spreading
I warm my hands on the flames of lies
In vain I scream against the wind
They don't understand my last testament

Escalation 666
Escalation 666 (my last testament)
Escalation 666 (my last testament)

My age you keep uncertain
This spell cannot be broken
Visions of eternal youth
We share one face together
Associates forever
Only you know the truth

Mirror mirror on the wall
Whose the master of them all?
Mirror Mirror split in two
Look at me, who are you?

I swim in my reflection
Mirror answer my question
Tell me what I want to hear
I see a perfect creature
Contracted human feature
I'll drown you with your vanity

Mirror Mirror on the wall
Whose the sickest of them all
Mirror Mirror split in two
Look at me - who are you?

No, my life is beautiful
I said, my life is beautiful

Mirror Mirror on the wall
Whose the sickest one of all
Mirror mirror split in two
Look at me - Who are you
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Whose the master of them all
Mirror Mirror split in two
Look at me - who are you?

No fear, no pain
Nobody left to blame
I'll try alone
Make destiny my own
I learn to free my mind
Myself I now must find
Once more
Once more

If I could fly
Like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail
If I could fly

So here I am
In solitude I stand
I've got dreams inside
I need to realize
My faith has grown
No fear of the unknown
No more
No more

If I could fly
Like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
I could ravage my jail
If I could fly

Sent to a world cold as steel
Don't know where else I have been
Where will I go? - I can't tell
Who would save us if we fell
Can you feel what I see?
In blind faith would you believe?
Don't share my point of view
But it may mean a lot to you

Tell me will we remember
How it used to be?
Will it be the same
In a time in the future?
Will there be a different way
Can one ever say?

Anthem for a distant world
We'll all be alike
Be there 'til eternity
One will see
When salvation comes our way

All my life I was sure
Kept my thoughts clean, real and pure
Just as I will always know
Were down here to learn and grow
I am my own entity
And the world is there for free
Keeps me alive 'til that day
When my soul will find the way

In another dimension
You may find paradise
We'll be safe and warm
I've been told there will be everyone
I held so close and near
There will be no fear

Anthem for a distant world
We'll be all alike
Be there 'til eternity
One will see
When salvation comes our way

Anthem for a distant world
We'll be all alike
Be there 'til eternity
One will see
When salvation comes
When salvation comes
When salvation comes our way

There I stood with the sun in my eyes
Dust on my face
And mouth parched and dry
Memories are racing
Flashing scenes through my mind
I know what's ahead
Today would be a good day to die

Once I thought I had a golden heart
Once I thought my dreams would never shatter
Now I stand here
Jaded and cold
Epitaph being carved on my tombstone

I would die for you - would you die with me?
No, you can't deny
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?
Blaze across the sky

Sun is going down
And there's no tomorrow
Sun is going down
Going down on me
Sun is going down
No more time to borrow
Dance with the devil
Sun is going down
For the lonely hearted
Sun is going down
In a blink of an eye
Sun is going down
On the departed
Laugh at the devil

I would die for you - would you die with me?
Caught in a fight
I was drawn again
I never thought I'd be betrayed
By my best friend
He lost his life as he went for mine
If this is the end
I want to die with you

Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?
Blaze across the sky

Sun is going down
Going down on me
Sun is going down
No more time to borrow
Dance with the devil
Sun is going down
For the lonely hearted
Sun is going down
In a blink of an eye
Sun is going down
On the departed
Laugh at the devil

I would die for you - would you die with me?
No, you can't deny
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?
Blaze across the sky

Sun is going down
Going down on me
Sun is going down
No more time to borrow
Dance with the devil
Sun is going down
For the lonely hearted
Sun is going down
In a blink of an eye
Sun is going down
On the departed
Laugh at the devil

Sun is going down
No more time to borrow
Sun is going down
Sun is going down
Sun is going down
...

I would die for you - would you die with me?
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?

Unchain your obscenity
Desirable enemy
Await my enlightening
Allow what your fate can bring

Now you're caught inside my cage
You are the object of my rage
Sin, I wash you clean again
I'm your redeemer

Cause I
I live for your pain
I live for your pain
I'm dying

My victim you are meant to be
No, you cannot hide nor flee
You know what I'm looking for
Pleasure your torture, I will endure

Now you are rust inside my cage
you are the object of my rage
Blood, I wash you clean again
I'm your redeemer

Cause I
I live for your pain
I live for your pain
I'm dying

I'll burn in your flame
I live for your pain
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'll burn

Now you are rust inside my cage
You - the object of my rage
Blood I wash you clean again
I'm your redeemer
Be my believer

Cause I,
I live for your pain
I live for your pain
I'm dying

I'll burn in your flame
I live for your pain
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'll burn

Blood in my pillow
Blood in my skin
Am I going mad
Or was this a dream?
There in the depth
The hollow souls wait
Voices surround me
Tempting my fate
Then out of nowhere
Figures in white
Guarding my soul in the fight

We are strong we are alive
We have faith in his might
We believe in the everlasting light
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there
We will fight for what's just and what's right
We damn the night

Out in the blackness
Shivering cold
Doubt takes on shape
Fear the unknown
Eyes of the fallen
Piercing their glance
Whispers of doom
Left without chance
Then out of nowhere
Figures in white
Shield my soul in the fight

We're strong, we're alive
We have faith in his might
We believe in the everlasting light
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there
We will fight for what's just and what's right
We damn the night

We're strong, we're alive
We have faith in his might
We believe in the everlasting light
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there
We will fight for what's just and what's right
We damn the night
We damn the night
We damn the night

Two lives, one fate
I have to leave
So will you follow me?
That's how it's meant to be
I reigned as God
I'm monumental
Soon I will arise
With you by my side
And we will radiate the skies
He who will gaze our lights
Will kill his mind, his vision blind

Tonight we are stars
Stars that shine on bright
Tonight we are stars
Stars immortal light
Tonight we are stars

All treasures all goods
We bury where we lay down to die
And pay for paradise
Await the highest thorn of all
And who will gaze our lights
Will kill his mind, is going blind

Tonight we are stars
Stars that shine on bright
Tonight we are stars
Stars inside the nights of ache
Love and hate
Hope and shade
Take you away

I will take you away
I'm gonna take you away
I'm gonna take you away

Tonight we are stars
Stars that shine on bright
Tonight we are stars
Stars immortal light of ache
Light of hate
Hope and shade
Part of the fate
Tonight we are stars

All board step right this way
The dark ride is leaving soon
Just sign your name on the dotted line
All I want is just your soul
Tighten your belt and lets go
Standing in line to get to the fairground
Heading to the wicked side
One way ticket, there is no returning
Leave your soul at the gates

Out of doubt, no hope
Satan feeds our madness
Insanity confirms where we stand
Spit the red vile breath and
Wrath is our gift that
Leads direct to Armageddon

Take a place - on the dark ride
Slowly creeping up - quickly coming down
Take a spin on the dark ride
May too far from the other side

Step inside and take this final journey
Your fantasies will come true
Inclination without liberation
Life's carousel is catching you

Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Driven to our final fate
Jump out of this game

Can we ever stop this ride to hell?

Take a place - on the dark ride
Slowly creeping up - quickly coming down
Take a spin on the dark ride
May too far from the other side

Is there any wonder?
Why we came about
Was it for love?
Or to let sin abound
Isn't it a wonder
Awake from blood thick dreams
Remove all the stones from our hearts
We must all believe

Oh, will we find a way to the other side
Heading for a light
Who is holding the key, why can't we see
The dark ride

I force the engine of your deadly sins
Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
I'm your pain when you can't feel
I know too well you'll follow me, you follow me down

Is there any wonder?
Why we came about
Was it for love?
Or to let sin abound
Isn't it a wonder
Awake from blood thick dreams
Remove all the stones from our hearts
We must all believe

Sightless the one who relays on promise
Blind he who follows the path of vows
Deaf he who tolerates words of deception
But they who fathom the truth bellow
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane
The madness of the game
Guilty the one with his silent knowledge
Exploiting innocence for himself
Dangerous he whom our faith was given
Broad is the road leading straight to hell
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane
The madness of the game
Dangerous he whom our faith was given
Broad is the road leading straight to hell
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane
The madness of the game

A priest caught in lust
Is roaming the red light
Pays to indulge his sins
Body cry
Each day he awakes
And prays for forgiveness
"Our Father", he cries to his God
"Set me free"
Once we may ask for forgiveness
Someday we could see paradise
His words echo to his disciples
Yet again he'll give in to his vice
Caught and bound by temptation
So ashamed of running free
Sweet embrace, captivation
Carnal truth against out beliefs
Deliver us
Deliver us
His suit hides the truth
His business is pushing
Supplying the kings of the street
Rich man's pride
Higher than high, a kid passing by
Blows off his head and escapes
Outta sight - outta sight
Who finds the road to redemption
The preacher, the kid, or the man
Who will decide it, I wonder
Vicious circle entangled and trapped
Caught and bound by temptation
So ashamed of running free
Sweet embrace, captivation
Carnal truth against our beliefs
Deliver us
Deliver us
Once we may ask for forgiveness
Someday we could see paradise
His words echo to his disciples
Yet again he'll give in to his vice
Caught and bound by temptation
So ashamed of running free
Sweet embrace, captivation
Carnal truth against our beliefs
Deliver us
Deliver us
Deliver us
Deliver us

Here I stand alone again
Hundreds all around (hundreds all around)
Didn't come here to make a friend
But to listen to the sound (listen to the sound)

Something's growing in my pants
As she looks into my eyes
Now I smile the whole damn night
But my dream acts cold as ice

It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
Just a little sign

Shouldn't I dare to talk to her
But what is it I would say (is it I would say)
Surely I'd look like a clown
For my smiles freeze on my face

It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
Just a little sign

It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine

It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
It's time for just a little sign
It's time, make believe the world is mine
Just a little sign
Just a little sign

Do you know what there is just behind your wall
Do you hate what you can't see on the spinning ball

Ignorant and wasted that's what you are
But you could be so much more
Listen to your TV, believe the words
And you're dumber than before

Try to see the real picture
To train your mind to read between the lines
Take your level higher that is your way
Just get up, start out today

Time seems an endless road when we are young
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Full synthetic anger that's what you breathe
It's a strategy for all
Telling people stories and bed time tales
But the real important false

So you grow the wrong seed inside your head
To the will of the modern priest
Supervised aggression instructed to sleep
That's the devil let you breed

All that we learn is just one point of view
Out there in the world it may not become true

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Time seems an endless road when we are young
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Sometimes there's no tomorrow
Sometimes you hate the day
You feel there may be something
That intends to screw with fate

Take a look at what surround you
Each time you watch the news
Your mind gets set by someone's will
A template you can't choose

Love and desire, dry ice or fire
Don't you just want to flee their magic spell

No mercy for the nations two people are at war
Beliefs divide the dream they share of peace and harmony
Their eyes look up to heaven, address our god in prayers
Their souls exposed, they may decease by emperor's decree

Look, how they're crying
There's no denying
Now change the channel you're remote control
And the tune goes on eternally

For those who share the fear
On a frequency for you and me
You stare but you can't see
You hear and you agree

We're all here for a reason
So we can't just hang around
There's so much left to see and learn
Make way for common ground

And those who head the wrong way
Will rate as minor class
As castaways they'll render fools
When the horsemen come to rule

Strike the last hour in their glass towers
Infinite lust has made the curtain fall

And the tune goes on eternally
For those who share the fear
On a frequency for you and me
You stare but you can't see
You hear but you agree
You agree

And the tune goes on eternally
For those who share the fear
On a frequency for you and me
You stare but you can't see
You hear but you agree

And the tune goes on eternally
For those who long to hear
And those freaks sense they're superior
We're hypnotised, you see
They wave and we agree

No matter how big we are
We dream of home
The place where we all belong
Therefore this song

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star

No time to see all our friends
There where we are
Ten thousand miles are quite long
And much too far

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (a star) - no

We are who we are
We are who we are
We are who we are
We are who we are

We are who we are
Never be a star
We are who we are
Never be a star

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star, never be (a star)

We are who we are
We'll never be a star (never be a star)
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (never be a star)

We are who we are
We'll never be a star (never be a star)
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star, never be

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (never be a star)

As a dancer she's undercover
Won the Big Don to be her lover
Had to make him tell her his secrets
About his business and about his street-rats

She had to become his trustful right hand
The bureau needed the files with his brand
She really was a damn good actress
Everybody called her 'Big Don's Mistress'

Oh, it's just a show
Put on for love
How could he know

Liar, liar
Sweet desire
Liar, liar
Who are you

She sent the messages thru her office
The Don reckoned he will face a judas
So he told her of a damned deceiver
Secured, in her he was a strong believer

He confessed to her being sick of all this
How he suffered in the deepest abyss
But saw in her the wish for a new life
To escape from there and make her his wife

No, not just a show
Put on for love
How could he know

Liar, liar
Sweet desire
Liar, liar
Who are you

Liar, liar
Play with fire
Liar, liar
Learn the truth

It had turned somehow
She had not seen how
Felt the bullet still flying
Straight went into her heart
Tore her old world apart
Now to live on she first had to die

There's a reason to live
There's a reason to live and let die
There's a reason to give
There's a reason to give in a lie

Liar, liar
Sweet desire
Liar, liar
Learn the truth

Liar, liar
Sweet desire
Liar, liar
Who are you

Liar, liar
Play with fire
Liar, liar
You learned your truth now

Forty million years ago
There was a boy called Leif
His skin was grey, his eyes were red
The tentacles counted five

Grown up in a normal house
His parents beloved son
There never was the slightest sign
He'd be the chosen one

Leif (No!)
Help us (No!)
Shelter us

He turns into the Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would I say (what would I say)
Would it be me, my friend

Down on earth we see a star
Dying in it's light
Then suddenly it all explodes
A new sun shines with Leif

Leif (No!)
Help us (No!)
Shelter us

He turns into the Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would I say (what would I say)
Would it be me

Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would you do (what would you do)
Would it be you, my friend

Leif
Help us
Shelter us

He turns into the Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would I say (what would I say)
Would it be me

Sun for the world
Sun for the world
What would you do (what would you do)
Would it be you, my friend

You're the one I would pick out in a million
You're the one I would wish for as the friend of my life (life)
If the whole world decided for a colour
Would pixels be any different in you (you)

Brave and smart against the rules
You smile upon the fools
I'll follow where you go
I want you to know

Don't stop being crazy
Wherever you go
Don't stop being crazy
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie we could not learn to fly
Oh no
Don't stop being crazy

When you walk you walk higher than the others
When you talk you talk merciless the bothering truth (truth)
Everyone seems remote-controlled nowadays
Only you have a frequency far beyond their ways (ways)

Still that strong you walk alone
Don't wonder where they're gone
I'll follow where you go
I want you to know

Don't stop being crazy
Wherever you go
Don't stop being crazy
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie we could not learn to fly
Oh no
Don't stop being crazy (crazy)

Still that strong you walk alone
Don't wonder where they're gone
I'll follow where you go
I want you to know

Don't stop being crazy
Wherever you go
Don't stop being crazy
It's a lie
It's a lie
It's a lie we could not learn to fly
Oh no
Don't stop being crazy

When we were lovers you called me names
But time goes on and you were gone
I got told you you're a big shot for the ties
And take it from behind

Now you took a new flat in a different town
And rumors are you're wealthy now
For that high class dress shows you earn well
Where strangers come and go

Do you feel good, do you feel fine
Did you achieve what you had in mind
Do you live cool, not too confined
What can you tell this old heart of mine

Some busty companion claims to know you well
Does night shift at some place somewhere
Said there's no one who has fun your way
In Moscow, Rome, LA

I wish I knew...
Where you are now
Your number's dead and you never call

Do you feel good, do you feel fine
Did you achieve what you had in mind
Do you live cool, not too confined
What can you tell this old heart of mine

Well I got no objections
I'm old enough, you know
But it's weird this night I seem to know you
Better than before

Do you feel good, do you feel fine
Did you achieve what you had in mind
Do you live cool, not too confined
What can you tell this old heart of mine

There was a time eating your mind
Eating your heart and your soul
Down to the bone always alone
Nobody waiting at home

Now allow that we unite our fires
Shout it out
Give yourself to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hell was made in heaven
I was made for you
Hell was made in heaven
Made for loving you in sin

Ten years ago you made the vow
Promised your life and your love
Before you have paid, nothing returned
What is enough is enough

Now allow that we unite our fires
Shout it out
Give yourself to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hell was made in heaven
I was made for you
Hell was made in heaven
Made for loving you in sin

Now allow that we unite our fires
Shout it out
Give yourself to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hell was made in heaven
I was made for you
Hell was made in heaven
Made for loving you in sin, in sin
In sin, in sin

Can you see now where I stand, my friend
Will you offer me your helping hand
And will you cross the void and speak your little words
Rush, I'm beggin' you, it hurts
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

I'm standing back against the wall
Dare I to move I got to fall
My heart is blinded by the light
I close my eyes forever

May not turn left, may not turn right
I sense a gap to every side
I'm standing back against the wall
Back against the wall

Get back!
Get back!

I can hear it coming closer now
Blaring silence of the dark below
Under my feet I feel it slide like sand
A frequent crushing down again, again, again and again

I'm standing back against the wall
Dare I to move I got to fall
My heart is blinded by the light
I close my eyes forever

May not turn left, may not turn right
I sense a gap to every side
I'm standing back against the wall
Back against the wall

Will you cross the void of pride
Then speak the words
Rush, I'm beggin' you, it hurts
It hurts, it hurts, yes it hurts

I'm standing back against the wall
Dare I to move I got to fall
My heart is blinded by the light
I close my eyes forever

May not turn left, may not turn right
I sense a gap to every side
I'm standing back against the wall
Back against the wall

Get back!
Back against the wall
Get back!
Back against the wall

Why do you run - answer me
Who do you follow - talk to me
What is the hidden - that I cannot see
What is the prize - you try to hide from me

I see you dying and I listen (listen)
And I listen (listen)
Listen to the flies
Listen to the flies

Who is the idol you obey
Give me a reason, you're afraid of me
You'd never been punished or never had pride
I see you circle round and round the shite

I see you dying
I see you dying

And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies

Why do you run - answer me
Who do you follow - talk to me
What is the hidden - that I cannot see
What is the prize - you try to hide from me

I see you dying
I see you dying
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies

And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies
And I listen to the flies

When I got told the other day, you said won't it be nice
To spend some time and share a look there was no thinking twice
The die was cast no time to lose as much as one can say
Didn't hesitate to call you back and things were under way

And if it wasn't for the circumstance and well against all odds
Well that's enough for feeling great the best we could have got
And just in case there's something wrong so much with you to share
Much better anyways than watch or stroll round everywhere

Nothing to say
We got it there
A long long way
Right in our hands

Nothing to say
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection
We'll have our way
Like we always do

Nothing to say
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection
We'll have our way
Like we always do

You called me up the other day just when I thought you would
And asked if we could break apart as things ain't been too good
I swallowed hard and got that feel I know it's called unease
The confidence I've kept so well just came down piece by piece

That's all it takes it's sad but done no way to disagree
Time takes toll and that's the way it's always gonna be

Cos it wasn't yet the circumstance but more than just a test
There's little left for feeling great and all I need's some rest
There's not a single glimpse of hope well someone took my place
It's yet another turn for me, i'll be messin' round everywhere

Nothing to say
We got it there
A long long way
Thereof our hands

Nothing to say
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection
I'll make my way
Like I always do

Nothing to say
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection
I'll make my way
Like I always do

So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh,oh

Nothing to say
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection
I'll make my way
Like I always do

Nothing to say
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection
I'll make my way
Like I always do

I got
I got nothing to say
I got nothing
Nothing to say

I got way
I see a rainbow rising
Nothing to spilled
Long long way
Nothing to say

We are gifted to be scared
We need stacks of weapons to survive
Marching for religious reasons
Marching on and on to save our lives

When will it have an end
How can we live in harmony
How can I understand the way things gonna be

Take me far away and set my spirit higher
Take me far away and set my soul on fire
And I pretend to understand
Whatever comes I'll be there for you

Genetically influenced
Is our harvest how far can we go
Someday my own clone will come
Take away my wife how could I know

Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I could just go insane
But when I see your smile it makes me strong again

Take me far away and set my spirit higher
Take me far away and set my soul on fire
And I pretend to understand
Whatever comes I'll be there for you

Fog in the streets
A church clock beats
Midnight - darkness all around

You better beware
You better take care
Be prepared for the shock

The time has come
And he's the one
Who's breathing down your neck

Coming from behind
Now it's your time
A loser will die

Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
Because the killer is on the attack

Surprise attack
Coming from the back
An expert of the deadly knack

Just take care
Just beware
Be prepared for the fight

Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
Because the killer is on the attack

Watch out - watch out

Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
Because the killer is on the attack

Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
Because the killer's
Because the killer's
Because the killer's on the attack

Wouldn't it be nice
To plunder with your eyes
Whatever there's for you to see
Is yours to be
Let me be there
Just tell me you don't care
Just say you pay me afterlife
However high the price

I know your secrets
I know it all

I know your secrets
I see the hidden without light
I am your sickness
Bitting you right behind your eyes
Don't try to kill me
I cannot die, a death you know
You and I will be
Heaven above and hell below

Brother, believe me
Father, conceive me
Perceive me

Time will be a turning wheel
We shove or retard
Time will a toy
Time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever
Minus one day
Say you will obey and I

I will show - I will show
I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe

Wouldn't it be nice
To reign and to decide
Whatever there's attracting you
Will give its due to you
Let me be there
Just say you want to share
A power no one will withstand
Just be my human hand

I know your secrets
You want it all

I will show - I will show
I will show you Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe

Alienation, elimination, chaos, no exoneration
No believers, all deceivers, no illusion, executions

We are King For A 1000 Years
We are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire
Binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men
We are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession
We are the king
We are The King For A 1000 Years

Ages of fire - Aeon of darkness, fear and hate
Wake up my creatures
Stand up you bringers of man's fate
No one can kill us
We cannot die, a death one knows
Mankind is sleeping
My victory near, their end so close

I know their secrets
I know it all

Goodbye sorrows
Borrow me your hand to turn the key
Release me - Believe me
Goodbye sorrows
Never more you have to fear futurity
Goodbye sorrows
Borrow me your hand to turn the key
Conceive me

Time will be a turning wheel
We shove or retard
Time will a toy
Time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever
Minus one day
Say you will obey and I

I will show - I will show
I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show - I will show
I will show you friend and foe

We are King For A 1000 Years
We are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire
Binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men
We are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession
We are the king
We are The King For A 1000 Years

I am the one who wants to show
You a secret of your cheating world
Wherever I will go - No one can see me
'Cause I'm the invisible man

I'm a creature with one goal
Rise up to heaven when the time has come
I have no body but a soul
Gods law is written on my way, forever

Time by time I think it's over
The malediction I have got
When the world was young
I've been captured in the name of god
To save people, but who cares?
Since a thousand years
Until the holy land will come

Here I am the invisible man
A lost fallen angel helping mankind where I can
My memories are there to save your world
For you I'm just the invisible man

There's the destiny you don't know
I'm a guardian angel and whatever you'll go
You fight through your life not alone
You can't hear me, nor see me
But trust the holy flow

Here I am the invisible man
A lost fallen angel helping mankind where I can
My memories are there to save your world
For you I'm just the invisible man

My mother died close to me
And while I lie sobbin' here
This world's going down with fear
Armies of minions is all I see
Creatures in anguish no place to flee
Living their nightmares the fall from grace
And so I'm standing here

I was born on judgment day
And I have no words to say
Don't know good or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you

There's no one beside me
I'm shuddering wearily
Utterly destitute and all
Nobility has let mankind
Turned into vultures, bewildered eyes
Shoved to the abyss, a twisting whirl
Under the blood red sky

I was born on judgment day
And I have no words to say
Don't know good or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you

I was born on judgment day
And I have no words to say
Don't know good or bad
Kinda feel so sad
But still, I sing this song for you

There's an abyss in your life
'Cause a good love's gone bad
You've lost someone for now and forever
She was the best you've ever had
Just let me go it's a hopeless endeavor
Don't stick your head in the sand
Don't you cry so much, it doesn't help
Not with her picture in your hand

Just when you lose your smiling face
Gonna bring you to a special place, 'cause I'm a

Drone, pleasure drone
And I wipe your tears away
Drone, pleasure drone
I'm gonna make you a perfect day

I'm made for sensing your mood
No reason for despair
Can you hear mechanical noises
When I buzz thru the air
To get you up I'll hand you presents
From my telescopic arm
No matter they're no hands
But my claws won't do no harm

And wherever there's bad vibes
I will detect them with laser eyes, cause I'm a

Drone, pleasure drone
And I wipe your tears away
Drone, pleasure drone
I'm gonna make you a perfect day

Drone, pleasure drone
And I wipe your tears away
Drone, pleasure drone
I'm gonna make you a perfect day
Drone, pleasure drone

Mrs. God, am I right?
That's your real address?
This time it's you
Ready to confess?
Free the masculine world
Cancel their humility

Mrs. God, can it be?
Can you be alike
One dressed to kill?
Walk on, high-heeled bride
This would state and explain
Why men are sometimes stumbling

Mrs. God are you there
Laughing at us is not fair
Mrs. God can't you see
All that shit you've done to me (and us)

Mrs. God, may I say
As wild card of my kind
We were so deceived (yeah)
You'd better left us blind

Mrs. God we are cool
We take it with a smile
But don't be cruel
Let's add it to the file
And in some 100 years
God has always had beard

Mrs. God are you there
Laughing at us is not fair
Mrs. God can't you see
All that shit you've done to me (and us)

He is God and he is light
He means everything in life
To her awaking mind
He's the one of two she loves
He's the one of two she snogs and hugs
In blind faith

But in the recent dead of nights
There was wonder, there was fright
Daddy's coming for a secret playing
Secret playing

Silent giants
Silent rain
Silence cover shame
Lying colours
Lurking bane
Under the silent rain

Daddy told her not to speak
Not to wail and not to weep
A promise she won't keep
Saw her mother at the door
Starting craven to the core
She won't care no more

So in the endless coming years
There was sorrow, there was fears
Daddy's coming for a secret playing
Secret playing

Silent giants
Silent rain
Silence cover shame
Lying colours
Lurking bane
Under the silent rain

What you sight you have seen
Where you go already been
The again you go through

Sister, the day you sell your skin

Sister, that day your soul gives in

Oh, oh, no matter what they do

Brother, dare not look left or right

Will there be a future - time beats in our hearts
Or will there be the fire - branding us his mark

I pray for all us people
Trying to solve the riddle
I don't know where we're going
I don't know if we're being true
On Occasion Avenue

Precious is your tasking
For a little bit of faking
For a tiny slight deception
For some insincere affection
(TV: ...sentenced to 16 years for
Marriage imposture and order
Of murder to his current wife whose
Life assurance's worth one million pounds.)

Much will be your power
By the essence of a flower
By seducement and cold rapture
By abusing mother nature
(TV: ...murdered close to
Old Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie.
Police assumes just one more execution
By competing drug-cartels).

Great will be your status
When you know how to lick anus
When you lie and swindle ruthless
And your biggest hero's Judas
...commited suicide in his
New York Penthouse.
He leaves no dependant
So stay tuned for the latest news of
"where do all the millions go").

Will there be tomorrow - Will there be the stars
Will there be a future - Time beats in our hearts
Will there still be laughter - Will there be relief
Will there be religion - Will there be belief
Will you see your people - From your former lifes
Will you know them this time - Will you win the prize
Will there be an ending - Will there be a start
Or will there be the fire - Branding you this mark

I pray for all us people - Trying to solve the riddle
I don't know where we're going
I don't know if we're being true - On Occasion Avenue

Mother, I dreamt of my last life

Follow the path that shines for you

How far you go - How good you do

In a house up the hill
Lays a boy, he's sleeping still
And the time's creeping by
Till the world prepares to die
Then again out of dust
Will arise what ended last
And the boy will awake
Give his dream a little brake

And the story now goes on and on and on
As the old has died the new arises
And a child will

Light the Universe
Light the Universe
We got blind, we can't read the signs
Light the Universe
Light the Universe
We don't find what's hidden in our mind

Under sand in sea
Covered with eternity
Beats a heart with no fame
Quietly whispering my name
When my time has run out
I will hear it very loud
Telling tales I once knew
But forgot by losing you

And the story now goes on and on and on
As the old has died the new arises
And a boy will

Light the Universe
Light the Universe
We got blind, we can't read the signs
Light the Universe
Light the Universe
We don't find what's hidden in our mind

Day by day you work off your claws
The line of fate in them
My not pay your loans
You got to keep goin' and goin' on
Strive day by day

Do you know, uh, do you know, do

Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive

Disenchantment, alienation
A slog to feed future estranged generations
And, retired, will you get rewarded
Your brave restraint?

Do you know, uh, do you know, do

Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive

Do you know what you're fighting for
The seed is sown
But we don't know the score
They will rule us, this breed of futility
You won't make an escape
'Cause we will still be alive

Uh, will they need you
Will they pay you

It don't get better if you're locked behind your door
It don't get better if you're hiding more and more
It may get better if you fight
It may get better if you'd wear a mask and scream
On Halloween

Come alive - Come alive
Rise and see - Rise and be for me
Come alive - Come alive
From the blue - Make it true for You
Come alive

It don't get better if you're acting fro a while
It don't get better if you drown in self denial
It don't get better without pain
It don't get better if you turn around and flee
To ecstasy

Come alive - Come alive
Rise and see - Rise and be for me
Come alive - Come alive
From the blue - Make it true for You
Come alive

You're reaching out in the dead of night
Searching for my hand
Your know I'm there in the waste of shadows
I'm your pain and friend

I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow

I ban the light and I leave you blind
If you try your eyes
I am enemy or a trusty fellow
In yuor wailing mind

I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I hide behind your shame
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
Crying out loud your name
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadows of you

There I cry for you - In the shadows
As I always do - in the shadows
You may oust me there - in the shadows
But I'm always there - in the shadows
In the shadows

I hear your silent cries
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I know your secret lies
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
I hide behind your shame
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
Crying out loud your name
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadows of you

There I cry for you
In the shadows
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
As I always do
In the shadows
I'm the Shade in the Shadow
The Shade in the Shadow of you

A little thing you sure will know
Why you came here tonight
And not to those other places
I could imagine there's PCs and DVDs
And TV shows
And sex in cars what else you like
Now right here is the place I got to be
Tomorrow I'll be far away
If you got time and nothing else to do now
Together we can change the world

Let's get it up
Rock's here to stay
With the best years of our lives we paid our share
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me what is in our way
To push this right in the face everyday

We spread it further on the town
Now, what'd ya know we're good
To incite a few more disciples
No time to waste makin' haste we're movin' on
Where we'll suspend another night

Do I see grinning faces all round here?
...and is this due to my words
Come treat me nice, y' know, I wasn't raised here
But I mean everything I say

Let's get it up
Rock's here to stay
With the best years of our lives we paid our share
Yeah, yeah
Now tell me what is in our way
To push this right in the face everyday

Listen my teachers
Listen my preachers
Let the world know he broke out
Mankind has failed just to see
What was inevitably
Satan has taken
And hidden painstakin'
One of the seven of fate
Out of the sea he has buried it
Under the mountain of greed

Stone by stone
You must carry off stone by stone
On and on
Until the final blinding light shows it's too late
Too late

There is a chance for everyone
Needs time but can be done
Fight the darkness
Don't be afraid my friends
The last key you have to find
And so will save mankind
Keep on trying when I give away

My life for one more day
My life for one more day
My life for hours you must find the way
My life for one more day

You, who will find it - You, who will bind it
And throw it back into the sea
Will be successor and follower
Of all my unowned might
Reckon with treason
For just one reason
Reckon with envy and hate
Too many people will always believe
In the sermon of night

Stone by stone
You must carry off stone by stone
On and on
Until the final blinding light shows it's too late
Too late

There is a chance for everyone
Needs time but can be done
Fight the darkness
Don't be afraid my friends
The last key you have to find
And so will save mankind
Keep on trying when I give away

My life for one more day
My life for one more day
My life for hours you must find the way
My life for one more day

Now I must leave
Now I must leave
Banish the evil
Trust and believe
Trust that you need
Nothing but love

There is a chance for everyone
Needs time but can be done
Fight the darkness
Don't be afraid my friends
The last key you have to find
And so will save mankind
Keep on trying when I give away

My life for one more day
My life for one more day
My life for hours you must find the way
My life for one more day

You think you're awake, the night was long
Don't be afraid, a new day is born
Just open your eyes and look around
You can't see a thing but still hear their sounds

Remember if you ask for release
Say the words and you'll be free

Run, run, run
Say the name of your enemy
Run, run, run
Lost and blind for eternity
Remember the words and you'll be free

Toss and turn, your sheets soaked with sweat
The poison of fear already reigns your head
The longer you wait the deeper you fall
Down to the demons you once dared to call

Remember if you ask for release
Say the words and you'll be free

Run, run, run
Say the name of your enemy
Run, run, run
Lost and blind for eternity
Remember the words and you'll be free

Can you hear me
Do you know me
I'm a taker
I'm a faker

Oh my God, don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Oh my God show me no way
Mercy, don't struck me a blow

Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go

May I argue
Is it all true
You forgive us
What is and was

Oh my God, please look away
Mercy, don't struck me a blow

Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go

Can you hear it
Or is it just summoning in my ears only?
It's talking
Words so true and old
I'm afraid to loose my mind
No, no, don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go

I love it loud, let's push it higher
Until the gain shows just red light
I love it true and played with fire
I enjoy a battle without fight

What I hear I adhere
Have no fear, say sincere

Are you metal
Are you metal
Are you
Are you
Are you metal
Heavy metal
Are you metal

Call me insane, call me hard wired
But it's the only noise I like
Believe in loud and fast and higher
I can tell the sound of wrong or right

What I hear I adhere
Have no fear, say sincere

Are you metal
Are you metal
Are you
Are you
Are you metal
Heavy metal
Are you metal

Sixteen years have passed since he,
one perfect of his kind,
the Casanova of his time,
crowned himself to conquer the land
in craving for lust
Lust, one of the seven deadly sins
Punishment he has suffered
Look at him what did he become,
who is he now?

My mind is burning like fire
And my evil heart stands still
All the time they put me in a wheel chair
And their meds give me the thrill

Hold on, what's going on?
Am I alive or dead, what's reality?
Come on, what's right or wrong ?
Am I stumbling through the streets or is it just a stupid dream?

I'm so lost no
I'm not fine
I'm close to borderline
Because I'm sick yeah
They call me Mr. Madman
I was out
For not long
Three lusty women
Walked me home
When they left, they
Called me Mr. Madman

My head is constantly spinning
And my world is going down
All alone I'm staring through the window
Cause the white men took my crown

Hold on, what's going on ?
Am I alive or dead, what's reality ?
Come on, what's right or wrong ?
Am I talking like E.T. or is it just a stupid dream ?

I'm so lost, no
I'm not fine
I'm close to borderline
Because I'm sick yeah
They call me Mr. Madman
Hey you, listen
I can sing
Those evil white men
Got me in
When they left here
They called me Mr. Madman
I'm done with my tricks
Cause yeah the straightjacket fits
When I'm out, you will get who's Mr. Madman!
I will take my last pill
Gettin' ready for the thrill
When I'm out you will know who's Mr. Madman!

Since ages now we're caught and occupied
With our basic civil rights denied
They came-to-conquer, took our beloved world
We're left to thrive in sorrow and disgrace

Some never knew what freedom was
Now, there's guards everywhere
Someone come!...
Rise up tomorrow to rectify the injustice being done

Raise the noise bring it on
I'll sing it while you're gone
Forever and ever
On with this for as long
There won't be another song now or whenever

But they're flawed, they crave the sound of our melodies
Though exposed to complex things just faint
This way they're rendered helpless easy prey
To be grabbed and bound safely locked away

Also here's one guy to play the pipe
Summons mean tunes that kill
Stadium like set up and verified
Knock 'em out with your skill

Raise the noise bring it on
I'll sing it while you're gone
Forever and ever
On with this for as long
There won't be another song now or whenever

Raise the noise bring it on
I'll sing it while you're gone
Now and forever
On with this for as long
There won't be another song now or whenever

I'm reaching out to find a reason
To find an answer and relief
I see a world so strange and cold
I see a world of rules and thieves
The day you're born you're under pressure
Your life is well prepared my friend
They surely teach you what to think how to behave until the end

All I ever wanted is a little piece of life
In a world where I decide things on my own
All I ever needed is a little piece of hope
And then things are gonna turn the other way

I'm living in a world of fantasy
Reality ain't good enough for me
And all that I can feel is nothing but sobriety

I'm living in a world of fantasy
Reality ain't meant or made for me
All that I see is so unreal

And once you're old enough they teach you
Not to be wishful not to care
About the plan that's been already made for you by other hands
But when you fail there's no one out there
To take your hand to catch your tears
The whole construction we have built leaves no such room for blinding fears

I wonder I wonder if I can handle it all
I wonder I wonder if I can carry the weight of the world

I wait in the cold
It should have been summer
It will start to rain
It's just not fair
But we are insane
We wait for the thunder
We wait for the pain
With open hair
Now the stage is on fire
Now explodes the air

Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh

Long live the king
Long live the king

We shout every line
We bang to the metal
Some call out his name
He makes the sign
Now the stage is on fire
Now explodes the air

Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh

Long live the king
Long live the king

You got to feel the spirit
Got to hear the Les Paul
You got to feel the action
Got to ride the death wall

Giving in it
Giving in it
Giving in it all
Giving in it
Giving in it
Giving in it all

The curtain is down
We scream like one choir
Emotions go wild
I shake my hair
Now the stage is on fire
Now explodes the air

Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh

Long live the king
Long live the king

No more feel, no more heal
No more light meets my eyes
Is it night, is it day
I'm alone, paralyzed

Everybody is waiting for the one
Everyone will freeze to death alone

The smile of the sun
Was stolen - someone
Has taken away
The heart of all day
The smile of the sun
Is gone and no one
But you drives away
The pain of the grey
Is anybody out there
Somebody help me

Got to breathe, got to move
Got to get back my life
Here's no hope, here's no joy
In this world full of strife
Gone away, gone astray
All I once believed in
It's my soul, it's my heart
It beats slower and dies

Everybody is waiting for the one
Everyone will freeze to death alone

The smile of the sun
Was stolen - someone
Has taken away
The heart of all day
The smile of the sun
Is gone and no one
But you drives away
The pain of the grey
Is anybody out there waiting
Anybody out there for me
The smile of the sun
Was stolen
Somebody help me

The smile of the sun
Is gone and no one
But you drives away
The pain of the grey

The smile of the sun
Was stolen - someone
Has taken away
The heart of all day
The smile of the sun
Is gone and no one
But you drives away
The pain of the grey
Is anybody out there waiting
Anybody out there for me
Is anybody out there searching
Anybody out there, call me
The smile of the sun
Was stolen
Somebody help me

You think you are alone
In this universe
What would you say if there are some
Armed with all you deserve

Destiny my friend you'll see
Counts nothing anymore
Open up your mind now and realize
They may come for sure

Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
You stupid mankind

Evolution everywhere
Who do you think you are
Like you are on the top of there ?
They may come for war
More evil, violent and vain
Than you could ever be
Can beam through time and bring you pain
All dead no one flees

Destiny my friend you'll see
Counts nothing anymore
Open up your mind now and realize

They may come for sure

Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
With no mercy
Dead and gone
No more fighting
They'll kill and burn your earth
You stupid mankind

They don't care
They don't care
They don't care
They don't care

Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
With no mercy
Dead and gone
No more fighting
They'll kill and burn your earth
You stupid mankind

We hurt who we love we destroy what we need
For profit we sell our souls
We're sowing disaster, the mess is complete,
Resources will soon be consumed

Open your eyes see the signs all around;
Hoping fate will have mercy on all
Someday the next generation will pay
But one day it' s too late to regret

If a mountain could talk it would tell us a story
To reign in love means just how to say sorry
If an ocean could cry we would drown in it's tears
Dusk breaks to dawn,
Which we cannot survive without love

Time passes by, time's gonna fly
Life is much too short to understand it
Don't even try

Time passes by, time's gonna fly
Don't fill up your heart with hate and anger
Give it a try

I know that things are going wrong sometimes
But then we need to get it right
I feel the pressure's so intense, sometimes,
I know we need a change tonight.

If a mountain could talk it...

Always on time always right on track
Expectations are set to the limit
Is it too late is there no turning back
All I need is a moment in peace

A tramp found dead, in the street, just made the news
Forensics report read 'drug abuse'
Found a warehouse slip in his sleeve
Marine corps major down-at-heel

They got to the place, unlocked the shed
Soon left awestruck, stunned, amazed
Among stuff and things lay pledges and bonds
Up to a few Mil in the end

The sage the fool the sinner
And what goes for you, one can't ever say
The sage the fool the sinner

One can't foretell fate, no way, no way

Sassy lady puts on her fav heels
Mirror checked, all done - snow white appeal
Adjust the dress, ready to leave
Grab some cash, cab's outside, wipe off a tear

On her way out, she turns once more
To wave her man good - bye
While in his sleep, he recalls thirty years - due to end that night.

Voices, I hear the people calling
Deep in my dreams
Choices, I made my own they've fallen
Apart with their screams

Waiting for my time
Oh Lord, please forgive me
Waiting for a hero,
An angel relieve me

In a land after life,
I'll give my sacrifice
In a world of dignity
There is no need to flee

In a land after time
I'll give my sacrifice
In a world of glory skies
There is no need to die

Chances, I took enough to fight it

All through my life
Advances, I had them all and lost 'em
They're out of my sight

Waiting for my time
Oh Lord, please forgive me
Waiting for a hero,
An angel relieve me

In a land after life,
I'll give my sacrifice
In a world of dignity
There is no need to flee

In a land after time
I'll give my sacrifice
In a world of glory skies
There is no need to die

Good-bye my friend
You were closer than a brother
Good-bye my friend
Close your eyes, don't be afraid
Life ain't the end
Strive with the wind
And I will follow some day
And I will follow your way
But not yet today
But not yet today

Can you hear - isolated
Can you see - aberrated
Can you sigh, I'm frustrated
Make my day
Can you feel animation
Shall I bring you salvation
No, I hate this temptation
Make my day
Pray, pray
I'm afraid
Afraid

Meet you somewhere
Far in the future
There I will wait for you
Far in the future
We're gonna make it through
I'll wait
Wait

Hear my voice, I don't care what they're saying
Feel my touch, I think you're only sleeping
They say you're like blind
They say you're like dead
Still the day will come, I may stop weeping

I play you heavy metal
Soul, punk, dance to unsettle
One sign please, one reaction
Make my day
Pray, pray
I'm afraid
Afraid

Wake up somewhere far in the future
There I will wait for you
Far in the future
We're gonna make it through
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

One of us is dying
One's left behind
Two of us are crying
One loud and one in mind
When your heart stops beating
I'll go your way
When you yet start speaking
You made my day, day, day
Got to pray, pray, pray
Make my day
Pray, pray
I'm afraid
Afraid

Meet you somewhere far in the future
There I will wait for you
Far in the future
We're gonna make it through
Far in the future
There hides another life
Far in the future
We let it all revive
I'll wait
Wait
Wait

I'm free, as free as one can be
In a world that cries for more equality
I'm free, as free as one can be
In this world so full of tears and misery
Today

Faster and faster we run into life, no time for emotions
Higher and higher we raise our limits too fast
Lost with protectors and will to survive, it's an illusion
Colder and colder it gets as we walk down the line

I don't wanna be a part
Of that foolish game
I just try another start
Nothing stays the same

I'm free, as free as one can be
In a world that cries for more equality
I'm free, as free as one can be
In this world so full of tears and misery
Today

Stronger and stronger we march into thy
Don't show no weakness
Don't show no mercy for those who are allied in pain
Stay where you are no complaining at all

Never get restless
Never just step out of line cause it won't be the same

I don't wanna be a part
Of that foolish game
I just try another start
Or else I go insane

I'm free, as free as one can be
In a world that cries for more equality
I'm free, as free as one can be
In this world so full of tears and misery
Today

I'm free, as free as one can be
In a world that cries for more equality
I'm free, as free as one can be
In this world so full of tears and misery
Today
Today
Today
Today

I have a dream no more such pain from dictators
No more such racists and no hell on earth
No politicians are tellin´ us lies any more
Life without enemies life without war without war

Some people are starving while some of us stay rich
Some pigs are the masters that pull all the strings

Faster we fall if we won´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before

I have a dream no more commanders and soldiers
Life without enemies life without war
No killing weapons no walkin´ on blood any more

Some people are starving while some of us stay rich
Ooh some pigs are the bastards left the poor all as slaves

Faster we fall if we won´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before stronger than ever before

Faster we fall if we won´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before

Faster we fall if we won´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before stronger than ever before
Stronger than ever be stronger than ever be
Stronger than ever before

I´m aiming high I wanna reach the sky
I wanna try to spread my wings and fly
No time to wait, no time to hesitate
It´s not too late I´m breakin´ free

I take the stars up to the sky
At least I carry on and try

Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow aiming high

I´m reaching out for peace and liberty
I´m breakin´ out far from reality
I´m comin´ out until my eyes can see
So clearer now until I´m free

I will take the stars up to the sky yeah yeah
At least I carry on and try for you

Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow aiming high

Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow I am aiming high
