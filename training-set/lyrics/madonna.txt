You must be my Lucky Star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are
I just think of you and I start to glow
And I need your light
And baby you know

Starlight, starbright first star I see tonight
Starlight, starbright make everything all right
Starlight, starbright first star I see tonight
Starlight, starbright yeah

You must be my Lucky Star
'Cause you make the darkness seem so far
And when I'm lost you'll be my guide
I just turn around and you're by my side

Come on shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right

You may be my lucky star
But I'm the luckiest by far

Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free
Stop playing with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me let me know
Baby let it show
Honey don't you fool around

Just try to understand, I've given all I can,
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Keep on pushing me baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms you love me till I just can't see
But then you let me down, when I look around, baby you just can't be found
Stop driving me away, I just wanna stay,
There's something I just got to say

Just try to understand, I've given all I can,
'Cause you got the best of me

Keep on pushing me baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Look what your love has done to me
Come on baby set me free
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
You cause me so much pain, I think I'm going insane
What does it take to make you see?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Don't put me off 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't quench my desire
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough
I put myself in this position
And I deserve the imposition
But you don't even know I'm alive
And this pounding in my heart just won't die
I'm burning up

I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love

You're always closing your door
Well that only makes me want you more
And day and night I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough
To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind and I know
That you want to want me but you can't let go
Come on, let go

Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
Or bending over backwards now would you be pleased?
Unlike the others I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire

Come on, let go

Burning up for your love
Ooo, yeah, I'm burning up Burning up for your love
Ooo, yeah, I'm burning up Burning up for your love
Come on, come on, I'm burning up Burning up for your love
Uh, uh, uh, I'm burning up Burning up for your love
Ooo, yeah, I'm burning up Burning up for your love
Come on, come on, I'm burning up Burning up for your love
Ooo, yeah, I'm burning up Burning up for your love
Uh, uh, uh Burning up for your love

You know you got me burning up, baby Burning up for your love
You know you got me burning up, baby Burning up for your love

Burning up for your love Burning up for your love
Burning up for your love Burning up for your love

I don't know why I thought that I could make you happy
These tears I cry for you are so hopeless, yeah
I don't know why I thought that we were going somewhere
But you grabbed your coat and you were out the door
And now I know you don't care

I know you're gonna take your love and run
I know you think I'm the foolish one
I know you're gonna turn around and say goodbye

I used to think you were my pretty angel comin' down
Well now you've just proven me wrong
What about the letters we have written
All the things we've said and done
I'll just stand here while you count the battles you have won

But I'm not gonna cry for you
'Cause that's what you want me to do
No I'm not gonna cry for you anymore

Take your love and run from me
Is this the way love's supposed to be
You don't think that I can see
But you can't fool me

But I'm not gonna cry for you
'Cause that's what you want me to do
No I'm not gonna cry for you anymore

I'm getting tired of waitin' around
I feel like I'm always trackin' you down
I don't wanna point my finger at you
But there's something you're forgettin'
Here's what you better do, you better

Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll
Think of me

You walk in and you see me cryin'
You apologize say you lost track of time
I'm not gonna cry anymore
You're gonna lose me too if you don't
Know what's good for you, you better

Tell me what I did to you to make you
Treat me so badly
If you wanna see me anymore
If you don't wanna see me walking out the door you better

Stop wastin' all my time
You know it could have been so fine
Hey boy I'm waitin' on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else
Stop thinking of yourself

You say that you need my love
And you're wantin' my body, I don't mind
Baby all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine

You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere, this

Physical attraction Physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction 
It's a chemical reaction, yeah
Sweet satisfaction, yeah

Trying hard to get away
But I can't seem to fight the way I feel
Even though you're not for real
Your touch is driving me

Crazy and when you smile
It's just makin' me want you more and more
Baby won't you stay a while
It could be such a fantasy, this

Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising, mmm
And you'll be walking slowly out the door
Out the door

You're confusing me
'Cause I don't know if you want me
But I know that I want you
And that's nothing to be ashamed of
What are you gonna do?

Well, you say that you need my love
And you're wantin' my body, I don't mind
Baby all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine

You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right

I know you've been waiting, yeah
I've been watching you, yeah
I know you wanna get up, yeah
Come on

Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing

Let the music take control
Find a groove and let yourself go
When the room begins to sway
You know what I'm trying to say

Come on, take a chance
Get up and start the dance
Let the D.J. shake you
Let the music take you

Let your body take a ride
Feel the beat and step inside
Music makes the world go 'round
You can turn your troubles upside down

Gonna have to change your mind
Gonna leave your troubles behind
Your body gets the notion
When your feet can make the motion

Dance and sing, get up and do your thing

I know you've been waiting, yeah, yeah
I see you sitting there, I've been watching you
Across the room, yeah, yeah
I've been watching you, I see you sitting there by yourself
Yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on

Let the music take control
Find a groove and let yourself go
When the room begins to sway
You know what I'm trying to say

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're O.K.
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right, 'cause we are

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day, 'cause they are

Living in a material world material
Living in a material world

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me, 'cause everybody's

A material, a material, a material, a material world

Living in a material world material
Living in a material world

Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Oooh you're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel, baby

Clouds just disappear

I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Oooh, oooh, oooh

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin, ooh, ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time?

Hurry up, I just can't wait
I gotta do it now I can't be late
I know I'm not afraid I gotta get out the door
If I don't do it now I won't get anymore
You try to criticize my drive
If I lose I don't feel paralyzed
It's not the game it's how you play
And if I fall I get up again now

I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

Got past my first mistake
I'll only give as much as I can take
You're never gonna see me standin' still
I'm never gonna stop 'till I get my fill
It doesn't matter who you are
It's what you do that takes you far
And if at first you don't succeed
Here's some advice that you should heed

I'm not afraid to say I hear a different beat, oh
And I'll go out in the street, yeah
And I will shout it again
From the highest mountain

Hurry up

Hurry up, I just can't wait
I gotta do it now I can't be late
I know I'm not afraid I gotta get out the door
If I don't do it now I won't get anymore
You try to criticize my drive
If I lose I don't feel paralyzed
It's not the game it's how you play
And if I fall I get up again now

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Shout it, shout it, shout it, ah
Over and over

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd ya have to go away
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love

You've got style, that's what all the girls say
Satin sheets and luxuries so fine
All your suits are custom made in London
But I've got something that you'll really like

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Feel the silky touch of my caresses
They will keep you looking so brand new
Let me cover you with velvet kisses
I'll create a look that's made for you

Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
All over your body, all over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes

Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la
When I look in your eyes
Baby here's what I see
I see so much confusion
And it's killing me

When I look in your eyes
Baby here's what I see
I see so much confusion
And it's killing me

Well I can't take it anymore, baby
Why don't you dry your eyes, try and realize
Love can open any door, and maybe
If you trust in me, I can make you see

Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la, come to me baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la, don't say maybe
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la, come to me baby
Shoo bee doo bee doo ooh la la

I can see you've been hurt before
But don't compare them to me
'Cause I can give so much more
You know you're all I see

Well I can make it on my own, baby
But I'd rather share all the love that's there
I don't want to be alone, and maybe
You will see the light, baby spend the night

Shoo bee doo bee doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo, baby

Come to me baby
Pretty darling, don't say maybe

He's a pretender, he knows just what to say
He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, that fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

It was so strange the way he held my hand
I wanted more than just a one night stand
He had a way of making me believe
That he was mine and that he'd never leave

I know that I should take my friend's advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why
He's a pretender
He's a pretender

I'm not afraid to fall a hundred times
And I'll believe in all your silly lies
I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind, I know all about your kind

He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, that fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

I like the way he moved across the floor
And when he danced with me I knew he wanted more
But in the dark things happened much too fast
I should've stopped him then, I knew it wouldn't last

He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, that fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

You, you make my life much brighter
You're always on my mind
You, you make my load much lighter
True love is hard to find
Sometimes I feel I have to get away
I change my mind when I look in your eyes
And when those clouds come in and try to darken our days
I'll always want you to

Stay, stay darling

You saw through my lies and deception
Yeah I was losing my way
You, you gave my life some direction
And now I'm ready to say
I know there's bound to be some hard times ahead
I'd be a fool to believe
But if you go I'd rather think of dying instead
I never want you to leave

When you walked out my door
I knew you'd be back for more
Let's leave the past behind
True love is so hard to find

Don't be afraid
It's gonna be all right
'Cause I know that I can make you love me
Love me, love, love, love, love me, love me

I'll always want you to stay

And then we can scoop, scoop, scoop, scoodooly be bop

You know you've got to stay
I think about you night and day
You know you've got to stay
I can make you love me
Love me, love me, love me...

Papa I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby

You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess, and I don't mean maybe - please

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby, oh
I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm...

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice, please

Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love, we are in love, so please

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep

Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh
Don't you stop loving me daddy
I know, I'm keeping my baby

Watch out!

I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart with the key

Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

A copper.
How do ya like that boys, a copper.
And we went for it, I went for it
Treated him like a kid brother
And I was gonna split fifty-fifty with a copper.
They were there waitin' to pin a medal on him
"Come on get up, get your hands up!"
Yeah, that's it, a nice gold medal for the copper
Only maybe he's gonna get it sooner than he thinks!

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

You think you can have my love for free
Well I've got news for you, that's not the way it's gonna be
So don't come hangin' round my door
If you're not ready to give, you're not gonna get much more

I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
Come on make my day

Can you feel the rhythm of my mind
Boy, I've got so much to give, but I don't want to waste my time
I can't let my heart put on a show
'Til you surrender baby, you've got to let it go

Drop your weapons, you'd better come clean
I've got you covered, I'll catch you when you fall to me
I'm not gonna hurt you, 'cause I'm not that kind
We're not goin' nowhere 'till you have a change of mind

"You haven't got a chance, come out with your hands up"
'Come out with your hands up', the man says
How do ya like that, ma? Heh!
Here's my answer, you dirty ...

Get up, stand tall
Come on baby make my day
'Cause my love is dangerous
Gonna have to play my way

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Get up, get up, get up, get up
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

I'm so good for you, baby here I come
I'm gonna get to you before the day is done
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Get up, stand tall
Come on baby make my day
'Cause my love is dangerous
Gonna have to play my way

I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

Working Monday through Friday
Takes up all of my time
If I can get to the weekend
Everything will work out just fine
That's when I can go crazy
That's when I can have fun
Time to be with my baby
Time to come undone

Where's the party where's the party
I want to free my soul
Where's the party where's the party
I want to lose control
Where's the party where's the party
I want to free my soul
Where's the party where's the party
I want to lose control

Couldn't wait to get older
Thought I'd have so much fun
I guess I'm one of the grown-ups
Now I have to get the job done
People give me the business
I'm not living in fear
I'm just living in chaos
Gotta get away from here

Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you show me how, I'm ready now

Slow down you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now

Where's the party where's the party
Where's the party where's the party
Someone tell me
Where's the party where's the party
Come on, come on, come on
Where's the party where's the party

how are you?
Oh yeah

Slow down you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now

Where's the party where's the party
Where's the party where's the party
Someone tell me
Where's the party where's the party
Come on, come on, come on
Where's the party where's the party

We can make it all right
We can make you dance
We can make a party last all night

Hey!
What?
Listen...

I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me baby this I know, 'cause it's

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh so many times
Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

No more sadness, I kiss it good-bye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's

True, so if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

'Cause it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's

Como puede ser verdad
How could it be true?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

The beautiful island

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

He told you, "I love you"

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama

He told you, "I love you"

He said he loves you

Where you goin' boy, I see your legs twitchin'
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
My daddy says you just need a good lickin'
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
You say you gonna be the king of Las Vegas
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
You're just a boy who comes from bad places
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Do fools fall in love with fools like you
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy

Why did you go and crash up your new car
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
Is it because it didn't take you too far
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
Why do you always have such a sad face
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
Is it because you want to get out of this place
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy

You're much too wild for this town
There's not much here that's gonna hold you down
You gotta lotta style it should take you far
Take you further than my back yard

Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la

Took my advice and got out of this place
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
This ole town ain't never gonna be the same
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
I really love you, I just couldn't tell you so
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
I should've said it then, now you'll never know
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy

Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy
Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy

Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la
Hey! I really love you Jimmy...

Make love not war we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight
But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl
That grows up in this world

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand
'Cause everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

Don't judge a man 'til you've been standin' in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away
'Cause it's the easy thing to do
You know that what I say is true

Love makes the world go round...

Make love not war we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight

La la la la la la la...

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no, no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
You'll never come down

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own
Baby on your own

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

To express himself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
You'll never come down

So please

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
You've got to make him
So you can respect yourself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now, then make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

I am ready. Are you ready also?

Are you wasting my time
Are you just being kind
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time
Are you just being kind
Don't give me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind losin' your mind
Oh no baby yeah

Are you wasting my time wasting my time
Are you just being kind
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time time, time, time
Are you just being kind
Don't go give me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong did you wrong
This is not a love song

Ooh, are you just being kind what
Am I losing my mind
Yeah
Don't wait

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run seem to have all the fun
But am I wasting my time she's so fine
Are you just being kind

Come tell me what all your enemies told you
Sugar, never ever did I do you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind losin' your mind
Oh no baby yeah

Are you wasting my time wasting my time
Are you just being kind
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time time, time, time
Are you just being kind
Don't go give me one of your lines

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
That's how I feel, don't fog my mind
Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

Oooh, are you just being kind
Embrasse moi what
Am I losing my mind
Pour la dernière fois
Yeah

Kiss me

For the last time

Love song, love song
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know love song
That this is not a love song that I want to sing

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

You need so much but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong but you pretend you don't see
I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife

They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

The bruises they will fade away
You hit so hard with the things you say
I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows
You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that she wouldn't cry
He's not in move with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is truth when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

She's had enough, she says the end
But she'll come back, she knows it then
A chance to start it all again
Till death do us part

Little girl don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain

Little girl never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try -- it's not the same

Keep your head held high -- ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

Little girl don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss -- kiss her goodbye

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

Little girl you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try -- but it feels like a lie

Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on -- but I'm doing it wrong
Can't kiss her goodbye -- but I promise to try

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny, I can't let go baby can't you see
Cupid please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side (oh baby I)
Cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life (I'm always singing it)
Cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good (and baby I)
Perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need for two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Who? You! Can't get away I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Who? You! Can't get away I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

Give me faith give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you

Baby face don't grow so fast
Make a special wish that will always last
Rub this magic lantern
He will make your dreams come true for you

Ride the rainbow to the other side
Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

If the land of make believe
Is inside your heart it will never leave
There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait
And dancing moons, for you

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade

On the merry-go-round of lovers and white turtle doves
Leprechauns floating by, this is your lullaby
Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips
Close your eyes sleepy head, is it time for your bed
Never forget what I said, hang on you're already there

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

It's funny that way, you can get used
To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father I have sinned

Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away

Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever

I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face
I'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs
To get attention I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said listen, you will always have a home

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just givin' to get something
Always wanting something back
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever

I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back, I know he cannot see
My hands trembling
I know he hears me sing

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ
He'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this
If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand
At least he was a man

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight but we cannot win this blind
Stand your guns against the wall
Who's next in line to fall

Tus lagrimas de tristeza
No me dejan olvidarte
Your tears of sadness
Will not let me forget you

For thou art the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory
Forever and ever. Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee,
Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy...

Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment
But most of all, because I have offended Thee, oh my God
Who art all good and deserving of all my love.
I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace
To confess my sins, to do penance, to amend my life,
And to avoid the temptations of evil.

Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment
But most of all, because my God, I have offended Thee
Who art all good
Like I knew you would
And deserving of all my love
I reserve, I reserve, I reserve
I reserve, I resolve
I have a reservation
I have a reservation!
What do you mean it's not in the computer??!!

Erotica, romance
My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance

If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try and reject it
If I'm in charge and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

I'd like to put you in a trance, all over
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic

Once you put your hand in the flame
You can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction
In a little bit of pain
I can see you understand
I can tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, well rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

I'd like to put you in a trance, all over
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic

Erotica, romance
I'd like to put you in a trance
Erotica, romance
Put your hands all over my body

I don't think you know what pain is
I don't think you've gone that way
I could bring you so much pleasure
I'll come to you when you say
I know you want me
I'm not gonna hurt you
I'm not gonna hurt you, just close your eyes

Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
All over me, all over me

Erotica, give it up, give it up romance
I'd like to put you in a trance
Erotica, give it up, give it up romance
I like to do a different kind of
Erotica, give it up, give it up romance
I'd like to put you in a trance
Erotica, romance
Put your hands all over my body

Only the one that hurts you can make you feel better
Only the one that inflicts pain can take it away

Erotica

You give me
You give me fever

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
Listen to me baby, hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
Bless my soul I love you, take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

You give me fever, fever
You give me, you give me fever

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie baby, you're my flame
He gave her fever

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

Fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, daddy oh don't you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Misses
Daddy, won't you treat him right

Fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever, 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn

This is not a love song
Bye bye baby

I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
You say you love me
You're thinking of me
But we're never together

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You had your chances
All your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

You're so beautiful
What makes you feel exciting?
What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say bye bye

I don't wanna keep the bright flame
Of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowin' in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adios

Uh, this is not a love song
I'd like to hurt you

What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

The first time and the last time
You can forget about it baby
Forget the rules, forget the fools
Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it baby, bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it baby
'Cause it's the first time and the last time
You'll ever see me cry
You fucked it up

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there
And my mama made me learn this song
You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you
That's why

The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper 
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend

You got to just let your body move to the music
You got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do

Warm inside, yeah
I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about

I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you in case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

Now what could be better than a home cooked meal
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

Colonel Sanders says it best
"Finger lickin' good"
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood
Are you still hungry; aren't you glad we came
I'm glad you brought your raincoat
I think it's beginning to rain

That's where my love is
Come inside
That's where all life begins
It's warm inside

Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't wanna feel blue

Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy

Something's happened and I can't go back
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me
What happens now, I know I don't deserve you
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you
Can't bring myself to let you go

This way

I'm not happy this way
This way

I'm not happy this way
Kissing some kind stranger's lips

Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings like you are now
What happened? What do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Break my heart
Don't break my heart

Break my heart
You broke my heart

Uh, next time you want pussy, huh
Just look in the mirror baby

Bitch!
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?
You'll be sorry

Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have what she wants
In a blink of an eye
Here she comes, acts like she's your best friend
Then you turn your back and she's off with your guy

She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts
What she does is a crime
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine

And gets away with it
Not this time

Here she comes, acting all dejected
So you give advice and she gives you her poison
Here she comes, little miss black widow
First she spins her web and she's stealing your boyfriend

Thief of hearts
Bitch

You'll do it, you'll take it
You'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it
You're over, you can't take it

You can't take it, not what's mine
I could break you, 'cause what you've done is a crime
Bitch
He's mine

Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have his child
Well anybody can do it
Here she comes, little susie ho-maker
Thinks she'll get respect if she screws it

Thief of hearts, bitch

You can't take it, not what's mine
You'll be sorry, 'cause what you've done is a crime

She's a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts, what she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine
She's a thief, thief
She's a thief, thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine

You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?

Stop bitch
Now sit your ass down

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

You think you're so smart
You try to manipulate me
You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

You think you're so shrewd
You try to bring me low
You try to gain control with your words

Friends they tried to warn me about you
He has good manners, he's so romantic
But he'll only make you blue
How can I explain to them
How could they know
I'm in love with your words
Your words

You think you're so sly
I caught you at your game
You will not bring me shame with your words

Too much blinding light
Your touch, I've grown tired of your words
Words, words
A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, words

I feel it, it's coming

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what this thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say, never go away

Waiting is the hardest thing
It's strange I feel like I've known you before
I tell myself that if I believe in you
And I want to understand you
In the dream of you
More and more
With all my heart and all my soul
When I'm with you
That by sheer force of will
I feel like a magical child
I will raise you from the ground
Everything strange
And without a sound you'll appear
Everything wild
And surrender to me, to love

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain, I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like

Rain, I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like

Rain
I'll stand out on the mountaintop
And wait for you to call my name
Rain

Why's it so hard to love one another
Why's it so hard to love

What do I have to do to be accepted
What do I have to say
What do I have to do to be respected
How do I have to play
What do I have to look like to feel I'm equal
Where do I have to go
What club do I have to join to prove I'm worthy
Who do I have to know

I'm telling you brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to challenge the system
Without living in pain
Brothers, sisters
Why can't we learn to accept that we're different
Before it's too late 
Why's it so damn hard

What do I have to learn to know what's right for me
What do I have to know
What am I going to do when I feel righteous
Where do I have to go
Who should get to say what I believe in
Who should have the right
What am I going to do with all this anger
Why do I have to fight

Bring your love, sing your love
Wear your love, share your love

Bring your love, sing your love
Wear your love, show your sister how

Brothers, sisters, what do I have to say
Brothers, sisters, how do I have to play
Brothers, sisters, who should have the right
Brothers, sisters, why do I have to fight

Why's it so hard to love one another
Love your sister, love your brother

Why's it so hard to love one another
Why's it so hard to love

Sing your love
Share your love

Love your brother now
Show your sister how
Love your brother now
Show your sister

Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only 23
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

What for?
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case
Ignorance is not bliss

Have you ever watched your best friend die what for
Have you ever watched a grown man cry what for
Some say that life isn't fair what for
I say that people just don't care what for
They'd rather turn the other way what for
And wait for this thing to go away what for
Why do we have to pretend what for
Some day I pray it will end

I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time

Tick tick tock, Mo is on the jock
I did her in the limo as we went around the block
Sucked the mole on her hip, licked the lipstick off her lip
She got real excited, yo she started to flip
She says 'Dre baby 'Dre baby oh
I said just relax, yo chill Mo
We made a right turn onto Central Park West
One hand gripped the car, the other on her breast

Did you do it? Ya know I did it
Did you do it? Ya know I did it
Did you do it? Ya know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

Uh, Ho's in the front for the 1990's
Walkin' around showing off their hinies
Wigglin' they're jigglin' they're swingin' and flingin'
9-7-0 Yo Ho, your phone's ringin'
You get a call from your John, you meet him at the mot'
He's chillin' in a pamper and a fur coat
Your head starts spinnin', you drunk too much gin in
Your jaw starts grinnin', and this is the beginnin'
Of a night of an average Ho
It ain't all about working on the streets no more
Here's another episode of dropping off a load
Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back so whadja do
I took her to my place yo, did she sit on your face
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop
I dipped it and I stripped it and I ripped it like before
I had her screamin', nope no diddily, nope no more
I can't stop once I get started
But yo honey, uh, get them legs parted

Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

They come with the rough stuff, boy we hit it, split it, and forgit it
In the same order as ya hear, boy I'm not frontin' me not front
Don't ask what, me tell ya the truth, you understand me eye?
The iron eye can get busy, you know what I'm saying?
Clean up me rifle, clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, me elephant rifle
Clean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, elephant rifle

I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different 'fros
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turnin' up my stereo

You didn't do it, he didn't do it
I made her go

Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

I still believe, I still believe
'Cause after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

Somewhere in fountain blue
Lies my secret garden

I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell, so

Here's my story my story
No risk no glory no glory
A little

Up and down and all around
It's all about survival

Here's my question my question
Does your criticism criticism
Have you caught up in what you cannot see
Well if you give me respect
Then you'll know what to expect, a little

Up and down and all around
I'll never be an angel
Up and down and all around, survival
Up and down and all around
I'll never be a saint it's true
Up and down and all around, survival

Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin' anybody else


Mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret for me

Mmm mmm, mmm mmm, mmm mmm

I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

I don't know where I stand with you
I never ever make any plans with you
I don't know what I mean to you
The only thing I know is I dream of you

And all that I know all that I know
Is I just don't understand just don't understand
Why my, mmmm, happiness always lies
In the palm of your hand, but

Sometimes I know what you're thinking next
But wouldn't it be better if I loved you less?
Sometimes I think that I made you up
But wouldn't it be better if I gave you up?

Are you surprised?

Tell me whatch-ya want, tell me whatch-ya need
Tell me whatch-ya want, tell me whatch-ya need
I, I betcha I, I give you whatch-ya need
Take a walk within me, venture through the dark sea
Can't you see, I need you beside me
Don't you see, I want you to want me

Are you surprised?
Are you surprised? Are you?

Get up on the dance floor, everything is groovin'
Get up on the dance floor, got to see you movin'
Let the music shake you, let the rhythm take you
Feel it in your body, sing la dee da dee

Don't stop doin' what you're doin' baby
Don't stop, keep movin', keep groovin'
Don't stop doin' what you're doin' baby
Don't stop, keep movin', keep groovin'

Come on join the party, let the bassline pump you
Bring your body over, baby let me bump you
I know I can groove you, you know I can move you
Feel it in your body, sing la dee da dee

Keep on doin' what you're doin' baby
Keep on, don't stop groovin'
Keep on doin' what you're doin' baby
Keep on, keep movin', keep groovin'

Keep on, keep movin', keep groovin'

I can't stop thinking of you
The things we used to do
The secrets we once shared
I'll always find them there
In my memories

But this heartache isn't going anywhere
In the public eye I act like I don't care
When there's no one watching me
I'm crying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I keep a picture of you
Next to my bed at night
And when I wake up scared
I know I'll find you there
Watching over me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

You'll always be inside of my heart
Inside of me

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love still carries on

I will always feel you
You'll always be inside of my heart
I'll always have you inside of me
I will always have you

Express yourself, don't repress yourself

And I'm not sorry I'm not sorry
It's human nature it's human nature
And I'm not sorry I'm not sorry
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me it's human nature

You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
I musta been crazy
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind
What was I thinking

You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breakin' all the rules I didn't make
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
I musta been crazy
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
What was I thinking

Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

I'm not apologizing
Would it sound better if I were a man?
You're the one with the problem
Why don't you just deal with it

Would you like me better if I was?
We all feel the same way
I have no regrets
Just look in the mirror

I don't have to justify anything
I'm just like you
Why should I be?
Deal with it

Love without guilt, love without doubt
Love without guilt, love without doubt
Love without guilt, love without doubt
Rejection, love without doubt

Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark
Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's gonna break your heart
Let go, let go

I don't, don't care if it's not right
To have your arms around me
I want to feel what it's like
Take all of you inside of me

In your eyes in your eyes, forbidden love
In your smile in your smile, forbidden love
In your kiss in your kiss, forbidden love
If I had one wish love would feel like this love would feel like this

I know that you're no good for me
That's why I feel I must confess
What's wrong is why it feels so right
I want to feel your sweet caress

If I only had one wish
Love would always feel like this
Wishin' on the stars above
Forbidden love
If I only had one dream
This would be more than it seems
Forbidden love forbidden love

Love without guilt, love without doubt
Love without guilt, love without doubt
Rejection Love without doubt
Is the greatest aphrodisiac

Love without guilt, love without doubt
Love should always feel like this
Heaven forgive me, never forbid me

These are my hands, but what can they give me?
These are my eyes, but they cannot see
These are my arms, but they don't know tenderness
And I must confess that I am usually drawn to sadness
And loneliness has never been a stranger to me, but

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

These are my lips, but they whisper sorrow
This is my voice, but it's telling lies
I know how to laugh, but I don't know happiness
And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to break me

And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to break me
Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
I was covered with dust, covered with sorrow
Love tried to take me in
Covered

Still, love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
Covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to break me
Love tried to welcome me
Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
But my soul drew back
Love tried to take me in
I was covered with sadness

Love tried to welcome me

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow

Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life
Who needs the sky
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life
Who needs the sky, when the ground's open wide
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs a smile, when a tear's so full of love
Who needs a home, with the stars up above
It's here in your heart I want to be carried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes
Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky
It's here in your soul I want to be married
You are my sanctuary

And the earth was void and empty
And darkness was upon the face of the earth

Is all of this pain so necessary
You are my sanctuary

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow
As the water follows the moon, silently

Who needs the sun with fluid steps
Who needs the sky around the globe
Who needs to sleep I hear your voice
You are you are my sanctuary
You are you are, you are
You are you are my sanctuary

Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

Let's, let's, let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious honey

Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

Traveling, leaving logic and reason
Traveling, to the arms of unconsciousness
Traveling, leaving logic and reason
Traveling, to the arms of unconsciousness

Let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious

Words are useless, especically sentences
They don't stand for anything
How could they explain how I feel

Traveling, traveling, I'm traveling
Traveling, traveling, leaving logic and reason
Traveling, traveling, I'm gonna relax
Traveling, traveling, in the arms of unconsciousness

And inside we're all still wet
Longing and yearning
How can I explain how I feel?

Traveling, traveling
Traveling, traveling, in the arms of unconsciousness

And all that you've ever learned
Try to forget
I'll never explain again

Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Light are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd
Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around no one around
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
One lonely star you don't know who you are

I've always been in love with you always with you
I guess you've always known it's true you know it's true
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

Say good-bye bye bye, say good-bye

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart breaking my heart
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played role that you played
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
One lonely star and you don't know who you are

Say good-bye bye bye, say good-bye

All the world is a stage world is a stage
And everyone has their part has their part
But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
You'd break, you'd break, you'd break
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you
I've always been in love with you
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

Say good-bye bye bye, say good-bye
Say good-bye

I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game
Some things cannot be bought

I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

Mmmmm, ooohhh, mmmmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmmmm, mmmmm

Now I find I've changed my mind
This is my religion

Put your head on my shoulder baby
Things can't get any worse
Night is getting colder
Sometimes life feels like it's a curse

I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't wanna carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor

Mmmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmmm
Swim to the ocean floor

Children killing children
While the students rape their teachers
Comets fly across the sky
While the churches burn their preachers

We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't wanna carry any more
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor

Let the water wash over you
Wash it all over you
Swim to the ocean floor

So that we can begin again
Wash away all our sins
Crash to the other shore

Mmmmmm

Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
Mmmmmm

Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else shall be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light I'm flying

Young velvet porcelain boy
Devour me when you're with me
Blue wish window seas
Speak delicious fires

I'm your candy perfume girl
Your candy perfume girl

Moist warm desire
Fly to me

I'm your candy perfume girl
Your candy perfume girl
I'm your candy perfume girl
Candy, candy

Rush me ghost you see
Every center my home
Fever steam girl
Throb the oceans

Your candy perfume girl
Your candy perfume girl
Your candy perfume girl
Candy perfume girl

Did I lie to you?
Candy perfume girl
Did I lie to you?
Magic poison

You're a candy perfume boy
A candy perfume boy
You're a candy perfume boy
You're candy

Candy perfume girl

The sacred nerve is magic poison
It's candy, it's candy

I'm your candy perfume girl
I'm your candy perfume girl
Boy, girl, boy, girl, boy
Candy

Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?

Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin

Kiss me, I'm dying
Put your hand on my skin
I close my eyes
I need to make a connection
I'm walking on a thin line
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

Touch me, I'm trying
To see inside of your soul
I've got this thing
I want to make a correction
I'm not like this all the time
You've got this thing
You've got this thing

Kiss me, I'm dying
Put your hand on my skin
I close my eyes
I need to have your protection
I close my eyes
I close your eyes

Kiss, kiss, kiss me

Kiss me, I'm dying
Touch me, I'm trying, ohhh
I'm not like this all the time
I'm not like this all the time

Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin

Touch me, I'm trying, ohhh
Put your hand on my skin
Put your hand on my skin

I'm not like this all the time
I'm not like this all the time
I'm not like this all the time

When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one

Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one

I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light

You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

Sky fits heaven so fly it
That's what the prophet said to me
Child fits mother so hold your baby tight
That's what my future could see

Fate fits karma so use it
That's what the wise man said to me
Love fits virtue so hold on to the light
That's what our future will be

Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go

Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

Hand fits giving so do it
That's what the Gospel said to me
Life fits living so let your judgments go
That's how our future should be

Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as they go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as I go

Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

If I could melt your heart

Your heart is not open so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do ya wanna go higher?

There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

Your heart is not open so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress

There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

Learn to say good-bye
I yearn to say good-bye

To have and not to hold
So hot, yet so cold
My heart is in your hand
And yet you never stand
Close enough for me to have my way

To love but not to keep
To laugh, not to weep
Your eyes, they go right through
And yet you never do
Anything to make me want to stay

Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told
You're to have, not to hold

To look but not to see
To kiss but never be
The object of your desire
I'm walking on a wire
And there's no one at all
To break my fall

You're to have, not to hold
You're to have, not to hold

You're to have, not to hold
You're to have, not to hold
You're to have, not to hold
To break my heart

Never forget who you are
Little star
Never forget how to dream
Butterfly

God gave a present to me
Made of flesh and bones
My life, my soul
You make my spirit whole

Never forget who you are
Little star
Shining brighter than all the stars in the sky
Never forget how to dream
Butterfly
Never forget where you come from
From love

You are a treasure to me
You are my star
You breathe new life
Into my broken heart

Never forget who you are
Little star
Never forget how to dream
Butterfly

May the angels protect you
And sadness forget you
Little star

There's no reason to weep
Lay your head down to sleep
Little star

May goodness surround you
My love I have found you
Little star

Shining bright

You breathe new life
Into my broken heart

Never forget who you are
Little star
Shining brighter than all the stars in the sky
Never forget how to dream
Butterfly
Flying higher than all the birds in the sky

Never forget who you are
Little star
Never forget where you come from
From love

Little star
Little star
Little star
From love

I ran from my house that cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
From my mother who haunts me, even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops, I ran to the sky
Out to the lake, into the rain that matted my hair
And soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me

I ran past the churches and the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards and the lady that never talks
Up into the hills, I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath, and thought about your death

I ran to the lake, up into the hills
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All forgotten names

I tasted the rain, I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels, I tasted my fears

And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
Black sky opened up, blinding me

I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes and up to the hill
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still

And I smelled her burning flesh
Her rotting bones
Her decay

I ran and I ran
I'm still running away

Breathe in, breathe out
I say a little prayer
How the gods above
Could be so unfair

I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There must be someone out there
There just has to be

Go on, go on
Don't sit there like a fool
You've graduated from
A different kind of school

I should be glad that I'm alive
It could have been much worse
I might have never loved at all
And never known what I am worth

How the gods above
Could be so unfair

Hey Mister D.J.
Put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby

Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like my Acid Rock

Hey Mister D.J.
Put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

Music

Music makes the people come together
Never gonna stop
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
Never gonna stop

Don't think of yesterday
And I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie, uh, uh
It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it everyday

Hey Mister D.J.

Never wanna stop

Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like my Acid Rock

Hey Mister D.J.
Put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy
Uh, uh, uh

Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like my Acid Rock

Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name

I'm in a trance
I'm in a trance

Cosmic systems intertwine
Astral bodies drip like wine
All of nature ebbs and flows
Comets shoot across the sky
Can't explain the reasons why
This is how creation goes

I don't want nobody else
All the others look the same
Galaxies are sliding into view
I don't even know your name

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning baby out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

Kiss me

I like to singy singy singy
Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy
I like to rhumba rhumba rhumba
Dance to a samba samba samba

Trance
I'm in a trance
Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name

You lost your reputation on a woman
You didn't understand or care to know
You get your education from your lovers
But now there's just no place for you to go

It doesn't pay
To be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay
To give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

You're set adrift with no direction
Just like a ship that's lost at sea
You don't care where you drop your anchor
Make sure it doesn't land on me

Walking around on a cloud
'Cause every girl you meet just trips on you
Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match
Now what will you do

Don't give it away

Walking around on a cloud
'Cause every girl you meet just trips on you
Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match
Now what will you do

It doesn't pay
It doesn't pay
It doesn't pay
To give your heart away
To a runaway lover

Uh uh, no way
Don't give it away
Uh uh, no way

This guy was meant for me
And I was meant for him
This guy was dreamt for me
And I was dreamt for him

This guy has danced for me
And I have danced for him
This guy has cried for me
And I have cried for him

Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today

This guy has prayed for me
And I have prayed for him
This guy was made for me
And I was made for him

I have no regrets
There's nothing to forget
All the pain was worth it

Not running from the past
I tried to do what's best
I know that I deserve it

And I thank you

You took a pretty picture
And you smashed it into bits
Sank me into blackness
And you sealed it with a kiss

If only I could let you go
Why do I need you so

It's amazing what a boy can do
I cannot stop myself
Wish I didn't want you like I do
Want you and no one else

You took a poison arrow
And you aimed it at my heart
It's heavy and it's bitter
And it's tearing me apart

If only I could set you free
You worked your way inside of me

It's amazing what a boy can say
I cannot stop myself
Seems I love you more than yesterday
Love you and no one else

Oh, it's amazing

It's amazing
Oh, it's amazing

I cannot stop myself
Wish I didn't
Love you and no one else

Cool I am
When I am with you
Cool I'm not
When I am lonely

I feel so sad
What I did wasn't right
I feel so bad
And I must say to you

Sorry, but

Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
What did you expect
I'm doing my best

I feel so sad
But you know I'll be true
I feel so bad
And I must say to you

Sorry, but

Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
I was dishonest
I will do my best
Yeah

Cool I am
When I am with you
Cool I'm not
When I am lonely

Mmm, mmm, yeah
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect

Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so, mmm

Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But please don't tell me to stop
But don't ever tell me to stop

Tell the leaves not to turn
But don't ever tell me I'll learn, no, no
Take the black off a crow
But don't tell me I have to go

Tell the bed not to lay
Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees

Don't you ever
Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop

Don't you ever
Don't you ever
Don't ever tell me to stop

Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the bed not to lay
Like a open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees

Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
'Cause it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you
What it feels like for a girl

Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

Strong inside but you don't know it
Good little girls they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl

Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips repenting

Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less

Strong inside but you don't know it
Good little girls they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak

In this world
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know what it feels like for a girl
What it feels like in this world

I can't remember
When I was young
I can't explain
If it was wrong
My life goes on
But not the same
Into your eyes
My face remains

I've been so high
I've been so down
Up to the skies
Down to the ground

I was so blind
I could not see
Your paradise
Is not for me

Autour de moi
Je ne vois pas
Qui sont les anges
Surement pas moi
Encore une fois
Je suis cassée
Encore une fois
Je n'y crois pas
All around me 
I could not see 
Who are the angels 
Surely not me 
Once more again 
I am broken 
Once more again 
I don't believe it 

I've been so high
I've been so down
Up to the skies
Down to the ground

There is a light
Above my head
Into your eyes
My face remains

I can't remember
When I was young
Into your eyes
My face remains

Into your eyes
My face remains

Selling out
Is not my thing
Walk away
I won't be broken again
I'm not
I'm not what you think

Dream away your life
Someone else's dream
Nothing equals nothing

Letting go
Is not my thing
Walk away
Won't let it happen again
I'm not
I'm not very smart

Why should I feel sad
For what I never had
Nothing equals nothing

Turn to stone
Lose my faith
I'll be gone
Before it happens

Selling out
Is not my thing
Walk away
I won't be broken again
I won't
I won't fall apart

Dream away your life
Dream away your dream
Nothing equals nothing

Turn to stone turn to stone
Lose my faith lose my faith
I'll be gone
Before it happens

Turn to stone turn to stone
Lose my faith lose my faith
I'll be gone

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life
Is it for me?
This type of modern life
Is it for free?

So I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life
Is not for me
This type of modern life
Is not for free

American life American life
I live the American dream American dream
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream American life

I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life
Is it for me?
This type of modern life
Is it for free?

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

American life

I tried to be a boy
Tried to be a girl
Tried to be a mess
Tried to be the best
Tried to find a friend
Tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top

Fuck it

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

Uh, fuck it

I'm drinkin' a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body
And you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper
And I'm feeling super-duper
Yo they tell me I'm a trooper
And you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out their bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm diggin' on the isotope
This metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?

I'd like to express my extreme point-of-view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

Do I have to change my name? American life
Am I gonna be a star? I'm the American dream
Do I have to change my name? American life
Am I gonna be a star? I'm the American dream
Do I have to change my name?

American life
I'm the American dream

Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood

There's something in the air in Hollywood
The sun is shining like you knew it would
You're riding in your car in Hollywood
You got the top down and it feels so good

Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

I lost my memory in Hollywood
I've had a million visions, bad and good
There's something in the air in Hollywood
I tried to leave it but I never could

There's something in the air in Hollywood
I've lost my reputation, bad and good
You're riding in your car in Hollywood
You got the top down and it feels so good

Music stations always play the same songs
I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong

Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
In Hollywood

Check it out, this bird has flown

'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
In Hollywood

Push the button
Don't push the button
Trip the station
Change the channel

'Cause I used to live
In a fuzzy dream
And I wanted to be
Like all the pretty people

I'm so stupid
'Cause I used to live
In a fuzzy dream
And I used to believe
In the pretty pictures
That were all around me
But now I know for sure
That I was stupid

Please don't try to tempt me
It was just greed
And it won't protect me
Don't want my dreams
Adding up to nothing
I was just looking for
Everybody's looking for something

I'm so stupid
'Cause I used to live
In a tiny bubble
And I wanted to be
Like all the pretty people
That were all around me
But now I know for sure
That I was stupid
Stupider than stupid

Stupider than stupid
Stupider than stupid

Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid, stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid, stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid, stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody everybody

There are too many questions
There is not one solution
There is no resurrection
There is so much confusion

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love vibration
You make me feel
You make it shine

There are too many options
There is no consolation
I have lost my illusions
What I want is an explanation

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love direction
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

There is no comprehension
There is real isolation
There is so much destruction
What I want is a celebration

And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love intention
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel

And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good
 
I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died

I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care what the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger give me a social disease

Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup, and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care what the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger give me a social disease

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you, you silly thing
Just take it from me

It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life, and that is why
No longer scared if I fall

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
Nothing fails

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
Makes me want to pray
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me want to pray

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause you're the one

I'm not religious

I got to save my baby
Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy
I got to teach him how to fly

I want to take him higher
Way up like a bird in the sky
I got to calm him down now
I want to save his life

And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know there is nothing to fear
And I know that love will take us away from here

Sometimes it's such a pleasure
Sometimes I wanna tear it all down
It's easy to be lazy
And hard to go away from the crowd

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
We'll never be the same

In the blink of an eye everything could change
Say hello to your life, now you're living
This is it from now on
It's a brand new day
It was time to wake up from this dream from this dream

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
You'll never be the same

And I know And I know that love that love will change us forever
And I know And I know that love that love
Will keep that love us together that love

And I know And I know that love that love will change us forever
And I know And I know that love that love will keep us together
And I know And I know, I know I know there is nothing to fear
And I know And I know that love that love will take us away from here

I'm not myself when you're around
I'm not myself standing in a crowd
I'm not myself and I don't know how
I'm not myself, myself right now

Jesus Christ will you look at me
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Don't really know if I should give a damn
When you're around, I don't know who I am

I'm not myself when you go quiet
I'm not myself all alone at night
I'm not myself, don't know who to call
I'm not myself at all

I always wished that I could find
Someone as beautiful as you
But in the process I forgot
That I was special too

I'm not myself when you're around
I'm not myself when you go quiet
I'm not myself all alone at night
I'm not myself standing in a crowd
I'm not myself and I don't know how
I'm not myself, myself right now
Don't know what I believe

I always wished that I could find
Someone as beautiful as you
But in the process I forgot
That I was special too
I always wished that I could find
Someone as talented as you
But in the process I forgot
That I was just as good as you

There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother
It was nice

Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

Oh mother, why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother
It was nice

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

I gotta give it up

Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for

I've got to give it up

I've got to let it go
I've got to give it up
Oh mother, oh father
I've got to give it up

I gotta give it up

I'm gonna wake up, yes and no
I'm gonna kiss some part of
I'm gonna keep this secret
I'm gonna close my body now

I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day

I guess I'll die another day
Another day
I guess I'll die another day
Another day
I guess I'll die another day
Another day
I guess I'll die another day

Sigmund Freud
Analyze this
Analyze this
Analyze this

I'm gonna break the cycle
I'm gonna shake up the system
I'm gonna destroy my ego
I'm gonna close my body now

Uh, uh

I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go

For every sin, I'll have to pay
I've come to work, I've come to play
I think I'll find another way
It's not my time to go

I'm gonna avoid the cliché
I'm gonna suspend my senses
I'm gonna delay my pleasure
I'm gonna close my body now

I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day

I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go

Uh, uh

I need to lay down

I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day

Another day

I want the good life
But I don't want an easy ride
What I want is to work for it
Feel the blood and sweat on my fingertips
That's what I want for me

I want to know everything
Maybe someday I will
What I want is to find my place
Breathe the air and feel the sun on my children's face
That's what I want

I go round and round just like a circle
I can see a clearer picture
When I touch the ground I come full circle
To my place and I am home
I am home

I want to let go of all disappointment that's waiting for me
What I want is to live forever
Not defined by time and space
It's a lonely place
That's what I want

I go round and round just
Round and round just

Who's that girl, who's that girl

When you see her, say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble, in a word get closer to the fire
Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

Quien es esa nina, who's that girl
Senorita, mas fina, who's that girl
Quien es esa nina, who's that girl
Senorita, mas fina, who's that girl

You try to avoid her, fate is in your hands
She's smiling, an invitation to the dance
Her heart is on the street, tu corazon es suyo
Now you're falling at her feet
You try to get away but you can't

Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now

Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
He's spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

Who's that girl
Now, who's that girl
Now, who's that girl
Now, who's that girl

I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

Should have left you standing right where you stood
Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come, and I'd lose my place
Now I'm on this trip, I took a fall from grace

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked, and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, Lord knows I've tried
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

Nowhere to hide
No place to run
Nowhere to hide
No place to run

Can't stop thinking about you babe, can't stop
Can't stop screaming and shouting your name, can't stop
Look out boy 'cause I'm going to the top
Of your list, can't stop

I've tried and tried to get next to you
My friends say I am blind I'll never break through
But I don't give in so easily
This I know, you just wait and see

I know that you're afraid that I might
Come steal your heart away in the night
But I can't take away what's not mine
You'll see, you'll come to me in time, can't stop

I've never gone the distance before
To find if love was worth giving more
I was born to love you I've got nothing to hide
I know about your secret side

So shut me out, I'll never let go
'Cause I can work a spell on your soul
I play the fool but it won't last for long
Oh no, 'cause baby I'm too strong, can't stop

Don't be afraid to try
Just let me love you for a while
You'll see, what it's all about
Oh baby I can't clear you out

Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop

So shut me out, I'll never let go
'Cause I can work a spell on your soul
I play the fool but it won't last for long
Oh no, 'cause baby I'm too strong, can't stop
Just can't help myself
You know I've got to have you and no one else can't stop

All work and no play,
Makes Dick a dull dull boy, career gets in the way.
Square jaw, ooo, such a handsome face,
Why do you have to save the human race?

Life of crime, no it never pays,
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away.
All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, had to let her go.

You're a man with a gun in your hand,
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All boss and no brains,
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain.
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call,
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys ever fall?

All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, I would never let you go.

'Cause I can show you some fun

And I don't mean with a gun. No.

You are a man with a gun in your hand;
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun, take it out of your hand;

Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't make time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.

Sooner or later you're gonna be mine,
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine.
Baby, it's time that you face it,
I always get my man.

Sooner or later you're gonna decide,
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide.
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter.

Baby, you're mine on a platter,
I always get my man.

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me.
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me.
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again.
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when.

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen.
I'm counting to ten, and then ...

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known,
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone.
Sooner is better than later but lover,
I'll hover, I'll plan.

This time I'm not only getting, I'm holding my man.

Come over here!

Some girls, they like candy, and others, they like to grind,
I'll settle for the back of your hand somewhere on my behind.
Treat me like I'm a bad girl, even when I'm being good to you,
I don't want you to thank me, you can just spank me. Mmm.

Some guys like to sweet talk, and others, they like to tease,
Tie my hands behind my back and, ooo, I'm in ecstasy.
Don't slobber me with kisses, I can get that from my sisters,
Before I get too cranky, you better...

Like hanky panky hanky panky,
Nothing like a good spanky good spanky.
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky.
Like hanky panky hanky panky,
Nothing like a good spanky good spanky.
Don't take out your handkerchiefs,
I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky guy.

Oooo.

Please don't call a doctor, 'cause there's nothing wrong with me,
I just like things a little rough and you better not disagree.
'Cause I don't like a big softie, no, I like someone mean and bossy,
Let me speak to you frankly, you better...

Oooo, yeah.

What about? Yeah. That's an interesting...
Oooo.
My bottom hurts just thinking about it.

She wants you to Treat me like I'm a bad girl,
She needs you to Even when I'm being good to you.
I don't want you to thank me Don't thank her, you better...

Hanky panky Oooh, yeah
Good spanky Get the picture?
Don't wanna cry, I just wanna

That's the way I came into this world,
The doctor said, "Lady, she's a beautiful girl."
He gave me a spanky and the doctor smiled,
So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it.
Yeah.
Hanky panky, good spanky, don't wanna cry, I just wanna

I'm going bananas,
And I feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas,
For I'm going bananas.

I'm non compos mentes,
And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist,
For I'm non compos mentes.

Who knows?
Could be the tropic heat
Or something that I eat,
That makes me gonzo.
I do carry on so, for I'm going bananas,
Someone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas
For I'm going bananas.

I'm going meshuga
All day long there's a man in my brain incessently playing "Booga wooga",
But I'm going meshuga.

There's bats in my belfry.
Won't you make sure this straightjacket's tight,
Otherwise I might get myself free.
Yes, there's bats in my belfry.

Who knows?
Could be the wine I drink
Or it's the way I think,
That makes me gonzo.
Oh, Doctor Alonzo says I'm going bananas,
Someone get me a bed in the "Casa de Loco" for all my mananas,
For I'm going bananas.
Yes, I'm going bananas.
Si, I'm going bananas.

My guy is really something, he's sensitive and shy
My guy is such a bumpkin, it doesn't take much to make him cry.
If you hurt someone helpless, it's like taking away all his toys,
He's just a cry baby boy.

My guy is sentimental, he's always feeling blue
He can be so temperamental and I don't know what I should do.
If you step on a little bug he cries all over the floor,
He's just a cry baby bore.

I don't want to hurt his feelings,
But his outbursts have me really
Boo-hoo-hoo-ing all the time,
If I turn out like him, I think I'm gonna cry, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la,
He's such a cry baby,
La, la, la, la, la, la.

And I'll tell you something else

My guy is such a wet noodle, he's always teary-eyed
He acts like a real cock-a-doodle, he can't even tell you why.
If you just play him a sappy song, he acts like his doggie just died,
He's just a cry baby guy.

No kidding, oh dear

My guy is such a whiner, he's worse than baddie so
A cockroach seen in the diner, and the tears flow out of the blue.
And if I ask him to knock it off, he goes and cries in the can,
He's such a cry baby man.

I love a cry baby,
La, la, la, la, la, la.
He's such a cry baby,
La, la, la, la, la, la.

Would you knock it off please? Thank you.

Seems I've played the game for much too long
I let people buy my love and I
Never got to sing my songs for you.

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose.
In the game of love you pay your dues.

Say that happiness cannot be measured,
And a little pain can bring you all life's little pleasures.
What a joke.

I was not your woman, I was not your friend,
But you gave me something to remember.
No other man said love yourself
Nobody else can.
We weren't meant to be,
At least not in this lifetime,
But you gave me something to remember.
I hear you still say, "Love yourself".

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose.
In the game of love I've paid my dues.

Guess I'm waiting for my place in your sun,
Wish I had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather.
What a shame, who's to blame?

I'm gonna show you that good guys don't always win
I'm gonna show you the brighter side of living in sin.
So when you're six feet under, you won't wonder why
Just 'cause you got a halo don't mean that you can fly.
If you thought it was over, you're way off track
You made a blunder, and...

You put me back, back in business,
This ain't no hit or miss, I'm gonna get my way.
'Cause you put me back, back in business,
You're my first witness, and I'm here to stay.

I'm gonna show you good guys always finish last
Speaking of virtue, being nice is a thing of the past.
When I want something done, I'll say it with a gun
Just 'cause you're an angel don't mean you're having fun.
I just wanted to thank you for what you lack
Hope they don't hang you, 'cause...

A tisket, a tasket, you've lost your yellow basket.
You don't know if you want to hit me or kiss me.
I just wanted to thank you for what you lack
Hope they don't hang you, 'cause...

He's back in business now
Give me a hand and I'll take a bow.
He's back in business now
Bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah.
He's coming back in style
Give me an inch and I'll take a mile.
He's back and why oh why
Bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah.

Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,
Which was fine with me.
Because I had rhythm, music, love,
The sun, the stars and the moon above,
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
That was when the best things in life were free.

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,
Which is fine with me.
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,
But look at what I got to go with 'em.
"Who could ask for anything more?", I hear you query.
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
More! More!

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew
More! More!

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
More! More!

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
More! More!

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more
Except all, all, all
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all have it all
You may find all else above find all else above
That though things are bliss,
There's one thing you miss, and that's
More! More!
More! More! More! More!
More! More! More!

What can you lose?
Only the blues.
Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
Say it to her, what can you lose?
Maybe it shows,
She's had clues, which she chose to ignore.
Maybe though she knows,
And just wants to go on as before.
As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door.

Well, if she does
Those are the dues.
Once the words are spoken,
Something may be broken.
Still, you love her
What can you lose?

But what if she goes?
At least now, you have part of her.
What if she had to choose?

Leave it alone
Hold it all in.
Better a bone
Don't even begin.
With so much to win,
There's too much to lose.

Let's dance, you can do a little two-step
I'll go anywhere that you step to, 'cause I'm following you.
My feet might be falling out of rhythm,
Don't know what I'm doing with them, but I know I'm following you.

Unlikely as it is to me, on the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat, but who's counting?
Encore, once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too, now I'm following you.

Fifty million

Dick Dick Sixty million Dick
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick, Seventy million, Dick,
Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Dick Eighty million, Dick Dick Dick
