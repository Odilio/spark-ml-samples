You think you gotta keep me iced
You don't
You think I'm gonna spend your cash
I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz
I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess
Think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby credit cards aren't romance
So you're tryna buy what's already yours
What I need from is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
Doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

A thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

Murda Inc

Even when I tried to call your name

And now you're hurtin' cos my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say

I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me sit and reminise
Tryin' to blind me with your blingin' bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' why you play the fool

La da da da da da

Baby, I got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend

But maybe we can be friends
La da da da da da

Oh Yes!

I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears,
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears,
The reason there’s two carrots in each of your ears,
I spurge with the paper ma, I don't care,
How ya like the pumps, boots, jeeps, and coops
Make celebrities, 50 fall off never,
What’s, mine is yours and what’s yours is mine,
So when I shine, you shine.
C’mon the finest Champaign we can toast to life,
Crab table in Vegas you can toss the dice,
Don't let your friends get ya confused, said 50 bad news,
I need ya in my life girl your too much to loose.

It’s funny cause, for a while,
I walked around with a smile but,
Deep inside, I could hear, voices telling me this ain't right.
Don’t you know, it’s not for you,
I always knew what I had to do.
But it’s hard, to get away,
Because I love you I just tried to stay.

I used to say I couldn’t do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I’ma be alright.
I used to say I couldn’t do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I’m gonna be alright.

Friends of mine, say to me,
They say you got control over me.
You’re not alone, I played my part,
I saw the way you were from the start.
Could I expect, so much from you,
You had a girl when I first met you.
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you

I used to say I couldn’t do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I’ma be alright.
I used to say I couldn’t do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I’m gonna be alright.

Said I wouldn't walk away,
Some days I want to stay,
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay.
Never thought it would be true,
Me livin' without you,
But now it's time for me to make that move.

Now when I tell ya what my wishes are you don't respect it,
When I smile at ya you don't smile back to reconnect it.
You ain't been gone long but, I already miss you,
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you.
All the talkin on the phone, all the time we share,
How could you fix your mouth to say, “I don't care”
I had plans for us, to buy ice together,
Engagement rings, and things and share life together,
Now when your friends tell ya 50 called, you’re like whatever.
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start,
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart.
Just want you to know you’ll always have a place in my heart.

I used to say I couldn’t do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I’ma be alright.
I used to say I couldn’t do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I’m gonna be alright.

Oh no, be alright
Oh no, says I’m gonna be alright

I used to say I couldn’t do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I’ma be alright.
I used to say I couldn’t do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I’m gonna be alright.

What's my motherfuckin' name?
R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggaz and pussy hoes, it's one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me, the only Man that help is above me, holla

I met so many men and
It's like their all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain

And when I'm feelin' sexy
Who's gonna come for me
My only problem is
Their insecurity

Ja Rule
Tired of bein' alone Yeah, yeah
See you arguin' on the phone Yeah, yeah
Are you tellin' all your friends Yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand My love

Ja Rule
Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

Ja Rule
Girl, I've been thinkin' bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets
Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
My baby lookin' at me, smilin' at me, laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin', ever growin' and we're gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nuttin'
I'm here to get it poppin', hoppin, let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

Now people lovin' me and hatin' me, treatin' me ungratefully
But not knowin' that they ain't makin' or breakin' me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

Now people screamin' what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas, mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

I can't wait, wanna see
How this night is gonna be
Just touch away
From feelin' forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
And in the middle of our world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine

We're walkin' on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I

Take my hand and close your eyes
Say the sweet little things
That make me cry
Catch my tears with a kiss
These special moments do exist
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
And in the middle of our world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine

We're walkin' on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I

It'll take much more than a lifetime
Baby, for this love to end
And it feels so good to know
That we are here in love again

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
Now if I gave you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See that's what you told me that's what you said
But if you want me
You have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me babe

Said you want my love and you've got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you want to live
With all I have to give
I need to feel true love
Or it's got to end, yeah
I don't want you
Trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
Don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do
Give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened for me
That's why I'm feeling...

I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round...

Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling...

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up, let's do it
C'mon people let's get loud
Let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya
What you gotta do

If you wanna live your life
Live it all the way and don't you waste it
Every feelin' every beat
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
Life's a party, make it hot
Dance don't ever stop, whatever rhythm
Every minute, every day
Take them all the way you gotta live 'em 'cause I'm going to live my life
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud

Nobody loses
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
To gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say

Could wait all night and day
To go to a party
Sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song he's gotta play
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
Grab a guy and move my feet
He's playin' my song

Play, come on
Play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come one DJ
Play that song
You that it turns me on
Just turn it up and turn me on

I don't care if everybody gone
Turn it up
'Cause it turns me on
Keep dancin' all night long
It feels so good that it can't be wrong
I get the chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind
Let me hear it
One more time

Play, come on
Play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come one DJ
Play that song
You that it turns me on
Just turn it up and turn me on

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
Have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now, leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Time goes slowly now in my life
Fear no more of what I'm not sure
Searching to feel your sole
The strength to stand alone
the power of not knowing and letting go
I guess I've found my way it's simple when its right
Feel lucky just to be here tonight 
and happy just be me and be alive.
Love, in and out, a mile in my heart,
And though life can be strange I can't be afraid
Searching to feel your sole, the strength to stand alone,
The power of not knowing and letting go
I guess I've found my way it's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight 
and happy just to be me and be alive
I guess I've found my way it's simple 
when its right feeling lucky just to be here tonight and
happy just to be me and to be alive.

When I sleep I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
Bout they way you used to hold me and say nothing will ever harm me
Oh, how you charmed me made me smile when I was down
Big pimpin' around the town you and me whenever they'd see you they'd see me
A lover and a friend to me you were how did it end
How it hurts to not have you in my life when I wanted to be your wife

You never know what you had till its gone
Treated you wrong
Now your gone away
But the love still lives here

I still got love for you still
After all we've been through still
I gave my heart to you
And baby you're the only one for me
There's other men then you
They cant come close to you
Once i said I love you
I know you'd be the only one

A good man you were to me always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me didn't matter what when or where you were there
I never thought wed part from the arguments Id start
When I just wanted some attention well im sorry baby for bitchin
if I could take back the words that I said to make you leave
Id be down on bending knees asking you to please forgive me

You never know what you had till its gone
Treated you wrong for so long now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

I still got love for you still
After all we've been through still
I gave my heart to you
And baby you're the only one for me
There's other men then you
They cant come close to you
Once i said I love you
I know you'd be the only one

All of the good times we've had together
Do they mean something to you
Do you ever wish we never split cause I
Still got love for you

I still got love for you still
After all we've been through still
I gave my heart to you
And baby you're the only one for me
There's other men then you

I gave my heart to you
And baby you're the only one for me
There's other men then you
They cant come close to you
Once i said I love you
I know you'd be the only one

Would you mind
If I took the time to get to know you
'Cause it's been a while since all we've been through
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change
Nothing stays the same, oh
I can see when I look in your eyes
You mean no harm
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm
And I could tell the love I have for you is still strong
And there ain't nothing wrong with me still loving you...

After all that we've been through
I find myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
'Cause I never give up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had
We just need to take it slow

In the past
You would act as if you don't really care
You would fight and argue almost anywhere
Looking back sometimes I feel like such a fool
For putting up with you
Baby please understand me if it seems I'm confused
It's just it might take me some time to get used to you
When I think of all the things we used to do
Baby, I just find myself still loving you...

After all that we've been through
I find myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
'Cause I never give up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had
We just need to take it slow

I believe you and me have the chance to make this right
Oh baby, if your heart is in it I'm still with it
Even after all this time has passed
Oh, I'm still loving you..

After all that we've been through
I find myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
'Cause I never give up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had
We just need to take it slow

Baby when I think about
The day that we first met the day that we first met
Wasn't looking for what I found
But I found you
And I'm bound to
Find happiness in bein' around you

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind

Taking away
The fact that I care about you
It's just your way, so sweet
Everything seems right around you
Did you know
That you have this calming way about you
In your touch
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I can see it your girl
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song your girl
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above

I'm happy to say
In a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile
When you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away
Any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows
I really feel, I'll always be your girl

The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I can see it your girl
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song your girl
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above

Your girl... Your girl...
I just wanna be the one who's true to you
I just wanna be the one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down
Your girl...

The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I can see it
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above

The one who's true to you, and down for ya
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya
The one who holds you down, I'm there for ya

The one the one... The one the one...

The one who's true to you, and down for ya
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya
The one who holds you down, I'm there for ya

The one the one... The one the one...

The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down

The one the one... The one the one...

The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down

The one the one... The one the one...

I can be anything you need...

I just can't control myself
Can't be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me
I don't think they understand
Why I love at your command
From the words you speak so deep
Our bodies meet, I have to have you

I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things

I think God made you for me
A mix of passion and fidelity
Baby, you're so complete
I write this song to let you know
That you will always be to me
My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend and my king

I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things

There's no way, I'd leave you
It's just not a reality
Sometimes I feel I'm
Living in a fantasy

Baby, don't go... Baby, don't go...
Baby, dont go... Baby, don't go...
Baby, don't go... Baby, don't go...

Ooh... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah...

It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you're mistreating me
And it's crazy, but oh baby
It don't matter, whatever
Don't phase me

I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce baby,
let's talk about this, man...

Well I'm bouncin' and I'm out son
I gotta leave you alone
'Cause I'm good
Holdin' down my spot
And I'm good
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine - right

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions while you're mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh yeah...
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone

The nights I waited up for you
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town
Thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you're angry, come here I'll prove it now come here

Stop playing
You gaming
I gotta leave you alone
'Cause I'm good
Holdin' down my spot
And I'm good
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine - right

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions while you're mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh yeah...
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone

People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill baby, you know me
You love me, I'm like your homie
Instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony
Don't bounce baby, console me
Come here

Ain't nothing you can say to me
That can change my mind
I gotta let you go now
And nothing will ever be the same
So just be on your way
Go head and do your thing now
And there's no more to explain to me, ya know
I know your game, I'm not feeling what you do
So I'm bouncing and I'm out son
I gotta leave you alone
Yeah, yeah...

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions while you're mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh yeah...
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions while you're mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh yeah...
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone

L-O-X, yeah
J Lo, yeah
Yeah, yo, yo
We off the block this year
Went from a load to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm going and I know where I'm from
You hear Lox in the air
Yeah we at the airport out in D-Block
From the block where everybody Air Force'd out
With a new white T, you fresh
Nothing phony with us
Make the money, get the mansion, bring it home Swizz

From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On The Six , to J Lo to this headline clips
I stay grounded
As the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told you
I'm real
I'm real even on Oprah
I'm real
That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from

I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and lovin' it
Rule has got me laughing kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real
To me its like breathing, yeah

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from

Yo, yo
It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, the assets
You get back what you put out
And even if you take the good route
You can't count the hood out
After a while you'll know who to blend with
Just keep it real with the ones you came in with
Best thing to do is stay low
The blocks and J Lo
They act like they don't - but they know
They can't get a penny from the block
And at the end of the day
She's still Jenny from the block, yeah

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from

Like an angel out the sky you came
Clearing up all the clouds, the sadness and the rain
So pure and healing was the love you bring
I knew inside... it felt so right

For me, I've struggled all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again, again, again...

I was scared to let go and trust your love
After what I've been through I had had enough
Whispering through your eyes, you never said a word
But something said... your heart's safe

For me, I've struggled all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again, again, again...

A friend is what you'll always have in me
I'm so grateful for the man you turned out to be
And it doesn't matter who you happen to meet
You'll forever be... a sacred part of me

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again, again, again...

Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers I've got loving eyes of my own

All I need is a place to be
And a way to feel
A space to figure out where I belong
A chance to know my thoughts
And find a way to show
What I feel
And if this is real, yeah

Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
'Im asking for you patience

So I've been praying praying
To find a way that I a way that I
Can be sure, the way that the way that
You've been sure with me sure with me

So I can share a deeper part of me, yeah

How much I adore
Those pretty eyes of yours

Blessed and cursed on the same day
The day that I first felt the power of you inside of me
Such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyone's life
When you know and everyone around you knows
That everything is changed
You're not the same
It's a new day

What I wanna know is
Are you willing to try
There's gotta be more meaning to this

spoken
Ladies, do you know what I'm talkin' about
When a man gets inside your soul
And it takes hold
And it won't let go
Hey, hey, hey....

I just wanna be... I just wanna be...

Taking away
The fact that I care about you
It's just your way, so sweet
Everything seems right around you
Did you know
That you have this calming way about you
In your touch
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you

I'm happy to say
In a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile
When you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away
Any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows
I really feel, I'll always be your girl

You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you

The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I can see it your girl
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song your girl
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above

You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you your girl
You are everything,
and everything is you

I'll always be, your girl...

The one who's true to you, and down for ya
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya
The one who holds you down, I'm there for ya

The one the one... The one the one...

The one who's true to you, and down for ya
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya
The one who holds you down, I'm there for ya

The one the one... The one the one...

The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down

The one the one... The one the one...

The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down

The one the one... The one the one...

I can be anything you need...

Now if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all I won't take your cheating on me
Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me you'll have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me baby

If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
Tell me baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby

You say you want my love and you got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you tryin' to get with me and I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do give myself to you I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
Tell me baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby

If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
Tell me baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby

I've been so
Caught up in the thought of me and you
Even though I love
someone else I know my heart belongs to you
tell me how did we
ever let the situation get this far
maybe we should just
try to hide the things we feel inside
things I know we can't deny

should've never told you
that I cared about you
didn't think that it would be, so bad
should've never kissed you
should've never held your hand
got to find a way to let these feelings go
what did I
do the day I let you slip into my soul
it was then, when I
realized that I would always want you in my life
no one else can know
of the things that we've been saying on the telephone
it would be so bad
if they even knew that me and you
were secretly into each other

should've never told you
that I cared about you
didn't think that it would be, so bad
should've never kissed you
should've never held your hand
got to find a way to let these feelings go

I'm so scared, trembling inside
cause I'm feeling like somebody else already knows
oh my god, I love you both so much
and to have to choose between the two
is hurting me so deep inside

should've never told you
that I cared about you
didn't think that it would be, so bad hum
should've never kissed you
should've never held you hand
I don't ever want to feel this way again

should've never told you
that I cared about you
should've never kissed you
should've never held your hand
should've never told you
that I cared about you
should've never kissed you
should've never held your hand
should've never told you
that I cared about you
should've never kissed you
should've never held your hand
should've never told you
that I cared about you
should've never kissed you
should've never held your hand
should've never told you
that I cared about you
should've never kissed you
should've never held your hand
should've never told you
that I cared about you
should've never kissed you
should've never held your hand

First you say that you have to go away
I never should have been with you anyway
Now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, 'cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you have to go away
I never really loved you anyway
Now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

Like a puppet on a string
You came and took control of me
Would've given anything to be your one and only

Filled my head with fantasies
Of what one day you'd give to me
Full of hope for what could be
I sat and waited patiently

For a time you were for me
Everything that I could need
Gave time and diamond rings
But something else was missing
You never stayed the whole night through
I suffered, prayed, and cried for you
After all that we've been through
I feel I never even knew you

There's no need to call me on the phone
I don't wanna hear from you no more
No need, don't call
Don't be a fool and stand outside my door
'Cause being the woman that I am
I gotta go on with other plans

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened for me
That's why I'm feeling...

I'm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me round...
Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling...

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up, let's do it
C'mon people let's get loud Let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya
What you gotta do
If you wanna live your life
Live it all the way and don't waste it
Every feelin' every beat
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it

You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say

Life's a party, make it hot
Dance don't ever stop whatever rythm
Every minute, every day
Take them all the way you gotta live 'em cause I'm gonna live my life

You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say

Life is meant to be fun
You're not hurtin' anyone
Nobody loses
Let the music make you free
Be what you wanna be Make no excuses

You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it, you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
How, tell me how will I know
Will my heart make me believe it so
Or can I trust the way I feel
If you could read my mind
You see how hard I've tried
Still I can't decide

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Oh, tell me could this be love

Do you know if it's true
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky
And do you know if you can fall for
Just a moment
Is a moment for all time
Why, why am I so unsure
Is that love knocking at my door
Or the sound of my beating heart
If you could read my mind
You know I just can't hide
What I feel inside

Oh, tell me could this be love

Like a movie scene , In the sweetest dreams , Have pictured us together
Now to fell your lips , On my finger tips , I have to say is even better
Than i ever thought it couold possibly be
Its perfect , its passion , its setting me free
From all of my sadness , The tears that i've cried , I have spent all my life

Waiting for tonight , Oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight , Oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say , Take my breath away , Love me now , leave me no never
Found a sacred place , lost in your embrace , I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set , On my empty heart , All alone in my bed
Tossing and turning emotions were strong , I knew I had to hold on


Gone are the days when the sun used to set , On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning , Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Baby come with me
I know I can set you free
If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off my love
If only for one night
I know I can make you mine
Touch you in that place you like
You'll be open off my love
Take a moment to stop and think about
The last time you felt like this
Come on baby, nobody's gonna see
'Cause I know you're feeling me
I can see it in your eyes
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide
When I touch you get hot
Then I got you where I want you

Don't waste another moment
Don't hold back
I'm gonna give you what you need
I'm gonna take you where you want to go
On a trip to ecstasy
I can see it in your eyes
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide
When I touch you get hot
Then I got you where I want you

I wanna be where he wants me to be
When he wants me to be
When he wants me
I'm gonna keep him feelin' me
I'm gonna keep him wanting me
I wanna be where he wants me to be
When he wants me to be
When he wants me
I'm gonna keep him up all night
I'm gonna keep it on his mind

I know it's on your heart
That a love like ours shall never fall apart
You're so afraid of the rain
So I'll take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same

Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't predend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try

Though I'm sure of what I feel
Never though a love so true that felt so unreal
And I'm a little afraid myself
But if you love me day by day
With all honest heart and a little faith
Baby time will tell the tale

Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't predend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try

How could you tell me that you love me
When I know you were just trying to play me
But you're the fool
'Cause I know how to switch the game up on you
And in the end I know who will lose
I played this game before
And I can't play no more
What do you take me for
It's not what you thought
So don't play games with me
'Cause I play to teach
And if you want to cheat
It won't be on me

It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you
I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with
Now baby you should know that it ain't that serious
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you
So that should let you know that what you do
I have done before, it's nothing new
So run those games on someone who can't be fooled
I can almost see lies coming through your teeth
In every word you speak you make it clear to me
That you're playing wrong and your game ain't strong
I've been in this too long, so just be moving on

Don't play games with my heart
I will let you go before you start

I saw you and fell in love
You saw me and fell in love, too
You and me; we fell in love with each other last night
I told you I was concerned
You told me of your concerns, too
Yet and still we both decided
To make love last night
Baby, please tell me

Where do we go from here my love
What are we doing baby
Boy you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want

I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together
Is what we choose
Oh my love
I think that we should talk
About us
Could this be a crazy dream
And if so then you're dreaming too
'Cause I know for sure that
You feel the same as I do
Could it be that we could be wrong
Even though we're feeling so right
I don't care because I know
That I want you tonight
And I know you want me too

You see all my live I've waited
Waited all my life
Just to be with someone like you

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant to me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Baby, never have I ever wanted anyone
Like I want you babe
Come and, let me show you just how much I feel inside
I got so much love

Oh baby when I get near you, ooh
I can't control what I'm feeling, baby
I got so much love to give you
That I would probably want you all the time

I gotta have your love
Need to feel your touch
Never get enough

I wish that I
Could spend all my days and nights wrapped in your arms
Spending time with you
'Cause all I see in this world
Is me and you and no one else, ooh
I want you more and more

Oh baby please understand me
I think that you deserve me, oh yeah
Cause I'm the type that would give you
All the love and affection that you need

Baby, I need to see you
Oh, please come over

One, you come to my room for a little game
Two you, I'll do every erotic things
I wanna make love, babe, very slowly
Three times in a row, all night I'll go

I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me
Come oh-oh-over

Body next to mine
Love dance, syncopated time
Sugar rush keeps me high
Sweet kiss on my thigh
I wanna make love baby, very badly
Feels good in the air
Every time you're here

Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Love I am saving for you
Hear what I'm saying
You I am craving
Love is here waiting for you
All day you're staying
Please no delaying
Patiently waiting for you
Don't keep me waiting, no time for playing
Sitting here waiting for you

I love when you come over
And when you come, it gives me
I love when you come over

Too much is on your mind
Gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time
Just let it flow
You say you need a break
There's nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you

Baby what's this you tell me
Things ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

Dance the night away
Party till the sun comes up
Go grab a friend, get on the floor
Come on and dance, dance, dance with me
DJ if you please

Nobody's on the wall
That's what I like
Come closer to me now and hold me tight
Tell me just how you're feeling right now
Are you really havin' a good time?

Just let yourself go
Dance on the floor
Nobody's stopping you
Do what you wanna do
Let the music take control
You can feel it in your soul
Come on and move your body to the groove

Up in the club, out on the floor
Move to the beat
Dancin' with me
DJ, DJ, play my music, dance the night away

Called You On The Phone
Said I'm Coming Through
Hope You're All Alone
'Cause I Got Plans For You
We Could Stay At Home Or Dance And Hand All Night
As Long As I'm With You
It Doesn't Matter What We Do
Don't Ask Me Where I've Been
Or What I'm Gonna Do
Just Know That I'm Here With You
Don't Try To Understand
Baby, There's No Mystery
Cause You Know How I Am

I'm Real, What You Get Is What You See
What You Trying To Do To Me
You Want To Say Your Mine
Be With Me All The Time
You're Falling So In Love
Say You Just Can't Get Enough
You're Telling All Your Friends

You Like The Way I Dress
The Way I Wear My Hair
Show Me Off To All Your Friends
Baby, I Don't Care
Just As Long As You Tell Them Who I Am
Tell Them I'm The One That Made You Give A Damn
Don't Ask Where I've Been
Or What I'm Gonna Do
Just Know That I'm Here With You
Don't Try To Understand
Baby, There's No Mystery
Cause You Know How I Am

I'm Real, What You Get Is What You See
What You Trying To Do To Me
You Want To Say Your Mine
Be With Me All The Time
You're Falling So In Love
Say You Just Can't Get Enough
You're Telling All Your Friends

You think you gotta keep me iced
You don't
You think I'm gonna spend your cash
I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz
I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess
Think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're tryin' to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
Doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

A thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart and get what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart and get what's in my heart

I could wait all night and day
To go to a party, sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
Cause my song he's gotta play
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song

Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on DJ play that song
You know that it turns me on
DJ just play that song
Just turn it up and turn me on

DJ just play that song
Cause I wanna be dancing all night long
Won't you play my play my play my play my
Play my favorite song

I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up, cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long
It feels so right that it can't be wrong
I get chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind
Play that shit again
Let me hear it one more time

Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on DJ play that song
You know that it turns me on
DJ just play that song
Cause I wanna be dancing all night long

I just wanna dance
Is that a crime?
Alright then, ooh, uh
Oh, ay, yes that's the hotness right there

Now Mr. DJ
I've asked you three times
Play my motherfuckin' song
He, he, he
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn the track up

It's like I'm lost
I don't know
This feeling that I have about you
Will you ever know?

Secretly, I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I semll your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you

Whatever I see
When I look at you across the room
Whatever I hear
I wonder if he loves me too
Whatever I do
I just think about you for hours
Oh baby and it's got me thinking of you

Whenever you speak
Whenever you, ooh
You're all I think about
Whenever you breathe
Baby, let me touch you please

It smells so good
I just wanna, kiss you
I wanna, lay with you
I don't know how to tell you
But secretly, I want you
I just wanna get next to you

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Said she gave you everything
She broke her back to be what you need
I tried so long to just compete
Can't take no more, losin' sight of me
I'm lettin' you know this can't go on
This one way street, I'm walkin alone
This time I'm breakin' free
I'm gonna find me

I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be
What you wanted me to be
If it can't be 50/50
Then you know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
Cause baby that's not me

Don't want you to think that I'm selfish
I'm just sick of your one track mess
If you can't meet me halfway
I think it's time that you be on your way
I love you but I can't baby you
If it's yo mama you want
You know just what to do
I looked in the mirror
Everyday I saw myself fading away
You tryin' to mold me into her
I loved you so, I put you first
But I can't live my life this way

I was so lost in love before
I couldn't see the light
But now I'm strong enough
To leave you now
So you better treat me right
Don't wanna throw it all away
So baby here's your last chance
Don't wanna fight with you
But I need more of you
Give me all or it's the end

I cooked, I cleaned
I washed your clothes
You were so mean, so ungrateful
At night I cried so many times
Tell me how could you go diss me
When you know one day you'll miss me
If it can't be 50/50
Then baby that's not me

I can't wait, wanna see
How this night is gonna be
Just a touch, away
From a feeling that is here to stay
We can make it last forever baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of our world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine

We're walkin' on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky, I, I, I

Take my hand and close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that make me cry
Catch my tears with a kiss
These special moments do exist
We can make it last forever baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of our world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine

Let's take a chance and try love baby
No I'm not givin' up
Till you tell me that you'll be in my life
Until the end of time

Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We gotta love thing we're talking about

The way you looked at me
Tells me you're sorry
You walked by me
Whispering you love me
When I tried to hold you tight
You pulled away
But you wanted me to stay
Instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me
Let's stop playing games
Don't turn away from me
Just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me
With those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel, baby

The way you tricked me
You know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to fix it
But all we did is fight
Because I gave you everything I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight
We gotta compromise

Baby, talk to me
And tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me
And let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me
And everything will be alright
But we must communicate
Tomorrow it could be too late

Cause I love you boy
And I need you here
Together we can make this thing work out
To think about what we could miss
Makes me wanna lose my mind

Talk to me
Come on, come on
Talk to me, oh
Makes me want a chance baby...

It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside 
I could hear voices telling me this ain't right/ 
Don't you know it's not for you/ 
I always knew what I had to do/ 
But it's hard to get away/ 
Because I love you/ 
I just tried to stay/

I used to say 
I couldn't do it but I did it 
After telling everybody that 
I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, 
I can feel it
And I know inside 
I'm gonna be alright
I said 
I couldn't do it but 
I did it
After telling everybody that 
I wasn't with it

Though it brings tears to my eyes, 
I can feel it
And that voice inside says 
I'm gonna be alright 
Friends of mine say to me 
They say you got control over me 
You're not alone, 
I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start 
Could I expect so much from you 
You had a girl when I first met you 
Did the best that you could do 
Now I realize I can't change you

Said I wouldn't walk away 
Somedays I want to stay
But leaving you is what I
need to do to be okay 
Never thought it would be true 
Me livin' with out you 
But now it's time for me to make that move
